Introduction
Dear Plan Member:
This Benefit Booklet gives you a description of your benefits while you and your eligible Dependents are 
enrolled under the University of California Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) (the “Plan”) offered by 
your University. You should read this Benefit Booklet carefully to get to know the Plan’s main provisions 
and keep it handy for reference. A thorough understanding of your coverage will allow you to use your 
benefits wisely. If you have any questions about the benefits shown in this Benefit Booklet, please call your 
Student Health Center or UC SHIP Member Services at 1-866-940-8306.
The Plan benefits described in this Benefit Booklet are for eligible Members only during the 2023-24 Plan 
year. The health care services are subject to the limitations and exclusions, Copayments, Deductible, and 
Coinsurance rules given in this Benefit Booklet.
Many words used in this Benefit Booklet have special meanings (e.g., Covered Services and Medical 
Necessity). These words are capitalized and are defined in the "Definitions" section. See these definitions 
for the best understanding of what is being stated. Throughout this Benefit Booklet you may also see 
references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “you,” and “your.” The words “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Claims 
Administrator. The words “you” and “your” mean the Member, Insured student and each covered 
Dependent.
If you have any questions about your Plan, please be sure to call Member Services at 1-866-940-8306. 
Also be sure to check the Claims Administrator’s website, www.anthem.com/ca for details on how to locate 
a Provider, get answers to questions, and access valuable health and wellness tips. 
Important: This is not an insured benefit plan. The benefits described in this Benefit Booklet or any rider 
or amendments attached hereto are funded by the University of California Student Health Insurance Plan 
who is responsible for their payment. Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health (the Claims Administrator) 
provides administrative claims payment services only and does not assume any financial risk or obligation 
with respect to claims.
Your University has agreed to be subject to the terms and conditions of Anthem’s provider agreement which 
may include Pre-service Review and utilization management requirements, coordination of benefits, timely 
filing limits, and other requirements to administer the benefits under this Plan.
Anthem is an independent corporation operating under a license from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
Association, permitting Anthem to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Marks in the State of 
California. Although Anthem is the Claims Administrator and is licensed in California you will have access 
to providers participating in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association BlueCard® PPO network across 
the country. Anthem has entered into a contract with UC SHIP on its own behalf and not as the agent of 
the Association.

Your Right to Appeals
For purposes of these Appeal provisions, “claim for benefits” means a request for benefits under the Plan. 
The term includes both pre-service and post-service claims. 
• A pre-service claim is a claim for benefits under the Plan for which you have not received the benefit 
or for which you may need to obtain approval in advance.
• A post-service claim is any other claim for benefits under the Plan for which you have received the 
service.
If your claim is denied:
• You will be provided with a written notice of the denial; and
• You are entitled to a full and fair review of the denial. 
The procedure the Claims Administrator will follow will satisfy the requirements for a full and fair review 
under applicable federal regulations. 
Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination
If your claim is denied, the Claims Administrator’s notice of the adverse benefit determination (denial) will 
include:
• information sufficient to identify the claim involved;
• the specific reason(s) for the denial;
• a reference to the specific Plan provision(s) on which the Claims Administrator’s determination is 
based;
• a description of any additional material or information needed to perfect your claim;
• an explanation of why the additional material or information is needed;
• a description of the Plan’s review procedures and the time limits that apply to them
• information about any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion relied upon in making 
the claim determination and about your right to request a copy of it free of charge, along with a 
discussion of the claims denial decision;
• information about the scientific or clinical judgment for any determination based on Medical Necessity 
or experimental treatment, or about your right to request this explanation free of charge, along with a 
discussion of the claims denial decision; and
• the availability of, and contact information for, any applicable office of health insurance consumer 
assistance or ombudsman who may assist you.
For claims involving urgent/concurrent care:
• the Claims Administrator’s notice will also include a description of the applicable urgent/concurrent 
review process; and
• the Claims Administrator’s may notify you or your authorized representative within 24 hours orally and 
then furnish a written notification.
3
Appeals (Grievances)
You have the right to appeal an adverse benefit determination (claim denial). You or your authorized 
representative must file your appeal within 180 calendar days after you are notified of the denial. You will 
have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information supporting 
your claim. The Claims Administrator’s review of your claim will take into account all information you submit, 
regardless of whether it was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.
The Claims Administrator shall offer a single mandatory level of appeal and an additional voluntary second 
level of appeal which may be a panel review, independent review, or other process consistent with the 
entity reviewing the appeal. The time frame allowed for the Claims Administrator to complete its review is 
dependent upon the type of review involved (e.g. pre-service, concurrent, post-service, urgent, etc.).
For pre-service claims involving urgent/concurrent care, you may obtain an expedited appeal. You or 
your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary information, including the 
Claims Administrator’s decision, can be sent between the Claims Administrator and you by telephone, 
facsimile or other similar method. To file an appeal for a claim involving urgent/concurrent care, you or 
your authorized representative must contact the Claims Administrator at 1-866-940-8306 and provide at 
least the following information:
• the identity of the claimant;
• the date(s) of the medical service;
• the specific medical condition or symptom;
• the provider’s name;
• the service or supply for which approval of benefits was sought; and
• any reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis.
All other requests for appeals should be submitted in writing by the Member or the Member’s authorized 
representative, except where the acceptance of oral Appeals (Grievances) is otherwise required by the 
nature of the appeal (e.g. urgent care). You or your authorized representative must submit a request for 
review to:
Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company
ATTN: Appeals
P.O. Box 4310, Woodland Hills, CA 91365-4310
You must include your Member Identification Number when submitting an appeal.
Upon request, the Claims Administrator will provide, without charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, 
all documents, records, and other information relevant to your claim. “Relevant” means that the document, 
record, or other information:
• was relied on in making the benefit determination; or
• was submitted, considered, or produced in the course of making the benefit determination; or
• demonstrates compliance with processes and safeguards to ensure that claim determinations are made 
in accordance with the terms of the Plan, applied consistently for similarly-situated claimants; or
• is a statement of the Plan’s policy or guidance about the treatment or benefit relative to your diagnosis.
The Claims Administrator will also provide you, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence 
considered, relied upon, or generated in connection with your claim. In addition, before you receive an 
adverse benefit determination on review based on a new or additional rationale, the Claims Administrator 
will provide you, free of charge, with the rationale.
4
For Out of State Appeals (Grievances)
You have to file Provider Appeals with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan in that geographic area
(“Host Blue”). This means Providers must file Appeals with the same plan to which the claim was filed.
Eligibility (Grievances)
Grievances relating to eligibility for coverage under the Plan should be submitted to your campus student 
health insurance office in writing, within 60 days of the notification that you are not eligible for coverage. 
You should include all information and documentation on which your grievance is based. The student 
health insurance office will notify you in writing of its conclusion regarding your eligibility. If the student 
health insurance office confirms the determination that you are ineligible, you may request, in writing, that 
the University of California Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) office review this decision. Your 
request for review should be sent within 60 days after receipt of the notice from the student health insurance 
office confirming your ineligibility and should include all information and documentation relevant to your 
grievance. Your request for review should be submitted to: University of California Student Health 
Insurance Plan, Risk Services, 1111 Franklin Street, Oakland, CA 94607. The decision of the UC SHIP 
Director will be final.
How Your Appeal will be Decided
When the Claims Administrator considers your appeal, the Claims Administrator’s review will not rely upon 
the initial benefit determination (claim denial). The review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer 
who did not make the initial determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial 
determination. 
An additional voluntary second-level review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer who did not make 
the initial determination or the first-level appeal determination and who does not work for the person who 
made the initial determination or first-level appeal determination. 
If the denial was based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, including whether the treatment is 
experimental, investigational, or not Medically Necessary, the reviewer will consult with a health care 
professional who has the appropriate training and experience in the medical field involved in making the 
judgment. This health care professional will not be one who was consulted in making an earlier 
determination or who works for the health care professional who was consulted in making an earlier 
determination.
Notification of the Outcome of the Appeal
If you appeal a claim involving urgent/concurrent care, the Claims Administrator will notify you of the 
outcome of the appeal as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of your request for 
appeal. 
If you appeal any other pre-service claim, the Claims Administrator will notify you of the outcome of the 
appeal within 30 days after receipt of your request for appeal.
If you appeal a post-service claim, the Claims Administrator will notify you of the outcome of the appeal 
within 60 days after receipt of your request for appeal.
Appeal Denial
If your appeal is denied that denial will be considered an adverse benefit determination. The notification 
from the Claims Administrator will include all of the information set forth in the above subsection entitled 
“Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination.”
5
Voluntary Second Level Appeals
If you are dissatisfied with the Plan's mandatory first level appeal decision, a voluntary second level appeal 
may be available. If you would like to initiate a second level appeal, please write to the Anthem Blue Cross 
address listed above. Voluntary appeals (Grievances) must be submitted within 60 calendar days of the 
denial of the first level appeal. You are not required to complete a voluntary second level appeal prior to 
submitting a request for an independent External Review.
External Review
If the outcome of the mandatory first level appeal is adverse to you and it was based on medical judgment, 
you may be eligible for an independent External Review pursuant to federal law. You must submit your 
request for External Review to the Claims Administrator within four (4) months of the notice of your final 
internal adverse determination.
A request for an External Review must be in writing unless the Claims Administrator determines that it is 
not reasonable to require a written statement. You do not have to re-send the information that you 
submitted for internal appeal. However, you are encouraged to submit any additional information that you 
think is important for review.
For pre-service claims involving urgent/concurrent care, you may proceed with an Expedited External 
Review without filing an internal appeal or while simultaneously pursuing an expedited appeal through the 
Claims Administrator’s internal appeal process. You or your authorized representative may request it orally 
or in writing. All necessary information, including the Claims Administrator’s decision, can be sent between 
the Claims Administrator and you by telephone, facsimile, or other similar method. To proceed with an 
Expedited External Review, you or your authorized representative must contact the Claims Administrator 
at the phone number listed on your Identification Card 1-866-940-8306 and provide at least the following 
information:
• the identity of the claimant;
• the date (s) of the medical service;
• the specific medical condition or symptom;
• the provider’s name;
• the service or supply for which approval of benefits was sought; and
• any reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis.
All other requests for External Review should be submitted in writing unless the Claims Administrator 
determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement. Such requests should be submitted by 
you or your authorized representative to:
Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company
ATTN: Appeals
P.O. Box 4310, Woodland Hills, CA 91365-4310
You must include your Member Identification number when submitting an appeal.
This is not an additional step that you must take in order to fulfill your appeal procedure obligations 
described above. Your decision to seek External Review will not affect your rights to any other benefits 
under this health care Plan. There is no charge for you to initiate an independent External Review. The 
External Review decision is final and binding on all.
6
Requirement to file an Appeal before filing a lawsuit
If you are still dissatisfied with the resolution after you have completed the Appeals Procedure, you may 
initiate proceedings in a court of law or other forum or file a claim in small claims court, depending on the 
amount you are seeking. Any such action must be commenced within three years of the plan's final decision 
on the claim or other request for benefits. If the Plan determines an appeal is untimely, the plan's latest 
decision on the merits of the underlying claim or benefit request is the final decision date. You must exhaust 
the plan's internal Appeals Procedure, other than voluntary level of appeal, before filing a lawsuit or taking 
other legal action, including filing a claim in small claims court against the Plan. 
The Claims Administrator reserves the right to modify the policies, procedures, and timeframes in 
this section in accordance with applicable law.

of the following methods: (i) registration of the partnership with the State of California; or (ii)
establishment of same or opposite sex legal union, other than marriage, formed in another
jurisdiction that is substantially equivalent to a State of California-registered domestic partnership.
• Child: The Insured student’s child(ren) as follows:
− Biological child under the age of 26.
− Stepchild: A stepchild under the age of 26 is a Dependent as of the date the Insured student
marries the child's parent.
− Adopted child under the age of 26, including a child placed with the Insured student or the
Insured student’s Spouse or Domestic Partner, for the purpose of adoption, from the moment
of placement as certified by the agency making the placement.
− Child of the Insured student’s Domestic Partner: A child of the Insured student’s Domestic
Partner under the age of 26 is a Dependent as of the Effective Date of the domestic partnership.
− Foster Child: A foster child under the age of 18 is a Dependent from the moment of placement
with the Insured student as certified by the agency making the placement. In certain
circumstances, the foster child age limit may be extended in accordance with the provision for
a non-minor Dependent, as defined in the California Welfare and Institutions Code Section
11400(v).
− A child for whom the Insured student is legally required to provide health insurance in
accordance with an administrative or court order, provided that the child otherwise meets UC
SHIP eligibility requirements.
− Dependent Adult Child: A child who is 26 years of age or older and: (i) was covered under the
prior plan, or has six or more months of creditable coverage, (ii) is chiefly dependent on the
student, Spouse or Domestic Partner for support and maintenance, and (iii) is incapable of selfsustaining employment due to a physical or mental condition. A Physician must certify in writing
that the child is incapable of self-sustaining employment due to a physical or mental condition.
The University may request proof of these conditions in order to continue coverage. The
University must receive the certification, at no expense to the University, within 60 days of the
date the student receives the request. The University may request proof of continuing
dependency and that a physical or mental condition still exists, but, not more often than once
each year after the initial certification. This exception will last until the child is no longer chiefly
dependent on the student, Spouse or Domestic Partner for support and maintenance due to a
continuing physical or mental condition. A Dependent adult child is considered chiefly
dependent for support and maintenance if he or she qualifies as a Dependent for federal
income tax purposes.
Note: If both student parents are covered as Insured students, their children may be
covered as the Dependents of either, but not of both.
15
2. Students are required to provide proof of Dependent status when enrolling their dependents in the Plan. 
Proof is required once per year in English or with English translation. The following documents will be 
accepted:

Types of Coverage
The types of coverage available to the Insured students and eligible Dependents are indicated at the time 
of enrollment through the Plan Administrator.
When You Can Enroll 
We do not require written applications from registered students. The University of California will maintain 
records of all students registered each academic term and will automatically enroll all registered students 
for coverage under this Plan each academic term. Students who provide proof that they have other health 
coverage that meets the University’s requirements may apply to waive enrollment in the Plan.
Students who involuntarily lose their other health coverage during the Coverage Period must notify the UC 
Irvine Student Health Center Insurance Services department with an official written letter of termination 
from the previous health insurance carrier. These students will be enrolled in UC SHIP as of the date of 
their involuntary loss of other coverage if they notify the Student Health Center Insurance Services within 
31 days of the loss of their coverage. If the student does not notify the Student Health Center Insurance 
Services within the 31 days, coverage will be effective on the date the student pays the full premium. The 
premium is not pro-rated for enrollment occurring after the start of a Coverage Period.
Non-registered students and eligible Dependents enroll on a voluntary basis must submit an 
electronic enrollment application for each academic term of coverage. Enrollment applications must 
be received within 30 days of the start of the coverage period. The coverage will begin on the first day of 
that period. Enrollment will not be continued to the next Coverage Period (academic term) unless a 
new electronic application is received. A reminder of re-enrollment will not be provided.
To enroll a Dependent, you must contact AHP Customer Care Unit at1-855-427-3206 or complete the 
online enrollment application found on your campus Student Health Center web page. Your dependents 
must meet all Dependent eligibility criteria established by the Plan Administrator and be one of the 
following:
16
Dependents of covered students may be enrolled, outside of an enrollment period for a particular Coverage 
Period, within 31 calendar days of the following events:
1. For Spouse, the date of issuance of the marriage certificate. 
2. For a Domestic Partner, the date that the Certificate of Registered Domestic Partnership is filed with 
the State of California or other jurisdiction
3. For a biological child, the date of birth.
4. For an adopted or foster child, the date of placement with the student or Domestic Partner.
5. For any Dependent, the date of loss of other coverage. An official letter of termination from the 
insurance carrier must be provided at the time of enrollment in UC SHIP.
6. For a child covered under a court order, the date that the court orders that the child be covered.
Non-registered students and eligible Dependents enroll by contacting AHP at 1-855-427-3206 or 
emailing ucship@ahpservice.com.
Important Note Regarding Newborn Children. If the student is already covered, any child born to the 
student will be covered under the student’s benefits from the moment of birth, provided Anthem Blue Cross 
is notified of the birth within 31 days. Coverage will be in effect for 31 days under the covered parent’s plan 
without additional cost to the student. If both parents are UC SHIP members, the newborn coverage will be 
assigned to the mother for the first 31 days.
For continued newborn coverage beyond the 31 days described in the preceding paragraph, the parent 
must enroll the newborn as a Dependent under UC SHIP within 31 days of the date of birth. The student 
must contact AHP at 1-855-427-3206 or complete the electronic application on your campus Student Health 
Center website to enroll the child as a Dependent. 
Special Enrollment Periods
If a student or Dependent does not enroll for coverage when they were first eligible, they may be able to 
join the Plan if they qualify for Special Enrollment. The student or Dependent must request Special 
Enrollment within 31 days of a qualifying event.
Special Enrollment is available for eligible individuals who:
• Lost eligibility under a prior health plan for reasons other than non-payment of premium or due to 
fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact.
• Exhausted COBRA benefits or Plan Administrator contributions toward coverage were 
terminated.
• Lost employer contributions towards the cost of the other coverage.
• Are now eligible for coverage due to marriage, domestic partnership, birth, adoption, or 
placement for adoption.
• Non-registered students must have been enrolled the previous term to be eligible for the special 
enrollment
17
Nondiscrimination
No person who is eligible to enroll will be refused enrollment based on health status, health care needs, 
genetic information, previous medical information, disability, sexual orientation or identity, gender or age.
Statements and Forms
All Members must complete forms or statements that the Plan may reasonably request. 
Any rights to benefits under this Plan are subject to the condition that all such information is true, correct, 
and complete. Any material misrepresentation by you may result in termination of coverage as provided 
in the “Termination and Continuation of Coverage” section. This does not apply, however, to fraudulent 
misstatements.
Address or Name Update
Let your Registrar’s office know if you have any changes or updates to your name or address while covered 
under the Plan. All correspondence will go to the address provided to the Office of the Registrar. If you 
would like to opt to receive communications electronically, log into the Anthem member portal at 
www.anthem.com/ca, to select email option and receive the information electronically.

How Your Plan Works
IF YOU ARE ENROLLED UNDER THIS PLAN AS A STUDENT AND YOU NEED NON-EMERGENCY
OR NON-URGENT MEDICAL CARE, YOU MUST FIRST GO TO OR CONTACT THE STUDENT HEALTH 
CENTER FOR TREATMENT DURING THEIR REGULAR HOURS OF OPERATION. THE STUDENT 
HEALTH CENTER WILL HELP YOU LOCATE PROVIDERS AND ISSUE REFERRALS TO MEDICAL 
PROVIDERS WHEN ADDITIONAL CARE OR A SPECIALIST IS NEEDED. COVERED DEPENDENTS 
MUST SEEK CARE FROM OFF-CAMPUS PROVIDERS AND DO NOT REQUIRE REFERRALS.
Student Health Center (SHC) is the student’s medical home. You may choose from among SHC providers 
for your primary, wellness care, some specialty care, and other services. Your Provider will diagnose and 
treat most illnesses, coordinate all of your health care and provide a Referral if you need care outside the 
Student Health Center. With the Referral in hand you choose from UC Family, Network Providers, or Outof-Network Providers. Review the benefits listed in this Benefit Booklet to determine your most costeffective option.
Referrals are made at the sole and absolute discretion of the Student Health Center. The Referral does 
not guarantee payment or coverage, and your Deductible, Copayment or Coinsurance may apply. The 
services you obtain must be Medically Necessary and a covered benefit under this Plan. Exception: a 
referral is not required to seek Emergency care, urgent care, LiveHealth Online, pediatric dental or vision 
care for members under age 19, services of a pediatrician, obstetrician, gynecologist or during winter 
break.
IF A STUDENT RECEIVES MEDICAL CARE WITHOUT PRIOR REFERRAL FROM THE STUDENT 
HEALTH CENTER, THE EXPENSES WILL NOT BE COVERED, EXCEPT FOR THE EXCEPTIONS 
LISTED ABOVE.
Note: Student Health Center (SHC) on campus does not provide medical, pharmacy, dental and vision
services for covered Dependents. Covered Dependents may seek medical services off campus from any 
health care professional or Facility without the need of referral.
Network Services 
Your Plan is a PPO plan. The Plan is divided into three sets of benefits: UC Family, Network and Out-ofNetwork. If you choose a UC Family Provider or a Network Provider, you will pay less in out-of-pocket 
costs, such as Copayments, Deductibles, and Coinsurance. If you use an Out-of-Network Provider, you 
will have to pay more in out-of-pocket expenses.
When you use a UC Family Provider, Network Provider or get care as part of an Authorized Service, 
Covered Services will be covered at the Network level. The Claims Administrator has final authority to 
determine the Medical Necessity of the service. Referrals are required from the Student Health Center to 
visit a Network Specialist, including behavioral health Providers. This does not apply to Emergency care, 
urgent care, LiveHealth Online, pediatric dental or vision care for members under age 19, services 
of a pediatrician, obstetrician, gynecologist or during winter break. 
If you receive Covered Services from an Out-of-Network Provider after we failed to provide you with 
accurate information in our Provider Directory, or after we failed to respond to your telephone or web-based 
inquiry within the time required by federal law, Covered Services will be covered at the In-Network level.
UC Family is a network comprised of University of California physicians and medical centers and UC 
campus student health centers. The five UC Health Systems have agreed to accept discounted rates, 
waive the Benefit Year Deductible and accept lower Co-Payments and Co-Insurance for certain services 
and supplies.
19
Network Providers include various types of "Network Providers" who contract with the Claims 
Administrator to care for you. These providers are called "Network Providers" because they have agreed 
to participate in the Claims Administrator’s preferred provider organization program (PPO), called the 
Prudent Buyer Plan. Network Providers have agreed to rates they will accept as reimbursement for 
Covered Services. The cost of benefits provided under this Plan will generally be lower for Network 
Providers than for Out-of-Network Providers. Referrals are required from the Student Health Center in 
order to visit a Network Specialist, including behavioral health Providers. This does not apply to 
Emergency care, urgent care, LiveHealth Online, dental or vision care for members under age 19, 
services of a pediatrician, obstetrician, gynecologist or during winter break. The University of 
California five health systems, including hospitals, and other medical facilities, and affiliated 
professional providers have agreed to special discounted rates for UC SHIP members.
Upon receiving the Referral to see a Doctor, call their office:
• Tell them you are an Anthem Member,
• Have your Member Identification Card handy. The Doctor’s office may ask you for your group or 
Member ID number.
• Tell them the reason for your visit.
When you go to the office, be sure to bring your Member Identification Card with you. You can provide a 
copy from your Sydney Health Mobile App from the App Store or Google Play or www.anthem.com /ca.
For services rendered by Network Providers:
1. You will not be required to file any claims. Network Providers will file claims for Covered Services for 
you. (You will still need to pay any Coinsurance, Copayments, and/or Deductibles that apply.) You may 
be billed by your Network Provider(s) for any non-Covered Services you get or when you have not 
followed with the terms of this Benefit Booklet.
2. Precertification will be done by the Network Provider. See the “Getting Approval for Benefits” section 
for further details.
Please refer to the “Claims Payment” section for additional information on Authorized Services.
Note: Payment of Emergency room claims is subject to review by the Claims Administrator. The Claims 
Administrator makes the final determination regarding whether services were rendered for an Emergency.
Contracting and Non-Contracting Hospitals are another type of service provider. They are different from 
a Hospital which is a Network Provider. The Claims Administrator has contracted with most hospitals in 
California to obtain certain advantages for patients covered under the Plan. While only some hospitals are 
Network Providers, all eligible California hospitals are invited to be Contracting Hospitals and most–over 
90%--accept. For those which do not (called Non-Contracting Hospitals), there is a significant 
benefit penalty in your Plan.
Out-of-Network Services and Benefits
Services which are not obtained from a Network Provider or as part of an Authorized Service will be 
considered an Out-of-Network service, unless otherwise indicated in this Benefit Booklet. You must obtain 
a Referral from the Student Health Center to seek treatment from an Out-of-Network provider, except for 
items listed above. 
20
For services rendered by an Out-of-Network Provider:
1. The Out-of-Network Provider can charge you the difference between their bill and the Plan’s 
Maximum Allowed Amount, except for Emergency Care, and certain non-Emergency Covered 
Services that you receive from an Out-of-Network Provider while you are at an In-Network Facility, as 
described under “Member Cost Share” in the “Claims Payment” section, unless your claim involves a 
Surprise Billing Claim;
2. You may have higher cost sharing amounts (i.e., Deductibles, Coinsurance, and/or Copayments), 
unless your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim; 
3. You will have to pay for services that are not Medically Necessary;
4. You will have to pay non-Covered Services;
5. You may have to file claims; and
6. You must make sure any necessary Precertification is done. Please see the “Obtaining Approval for 
Benefits” section for further details.
Exceptions to Out-of-Network Services and Benefits:
Preventive services are excluded out-of-network;
Your Co-Insurance for Out-of-Network Providers will be the same as for Network Providers for the 
following services. You may be responsible for charges which exceed the Maximum Allowed Amount.
a. Emergency services provided by other than a Hospital;
b. The first 48 hours of Emergency services provided by a hospital (the Network Provider Co-Insurance 
will continue to apply to an Out-of-Network Provider beyond the first 48 hours if you, in the Claims 
Administrator’s judgment, cannot be safely moved); 
c. The services of an Out-of-Network Provider when Anthem approves a referral from a Physician who 
is a Network Provider or from the Student Health Centers (see the provision AUTHORIZED SERVICES on 
page 113);
d. Charges by a type of Physician not represented in the Prudent Buyer Plan network (for example, an 
audiologist);
e. Clinical Trials; or
f. The services of an anesthesiologist and assistant surgeon who are Out-of-Network Providers when 
the Hospital where the surgery is to be performed, or Ambulatory Surgery Center, AND the operating 
Physician are BOTH Network Providers.
Note: Payment of Emergency room claims is subject to review by the Claims Administrator. The Claims 
Administrator makes the final determination regarding whether services were rendered for an Emergency.
21
Emergency Services Provided by Out-of-Network Providers. Out-of-Network Providers may send 
you a bill and collect the amount of the Out-of-Network Provider’s charge that exceeds the Maximum 
Allowed Amount under this Plan. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum 
Allowed Amount and the amount the Out-of-Network Provider charges. This amount can be significant. 
If you receive a bill, please contact your campus Student Health Center’s Insurance Services office at 1-
949-824-2388 for additional information or assistance. Covered Dependents must contact the Claims 
Administrator at 1-866-940-8306 for additional information or assistance.
Surprise Billing Claims
Surprise Billing Claims are described in the “Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 Notice” at the back 
of this Booklet. Please refer to that section for further details.

How to Find a Provider in the Network
There are several ways you can find out if a Provider or Facility is in the Claims Administrator’s network. 
You can also find out where they are located and details about their license or training:
• See your Plan’s directory of Network Providers at www.anthem.com/ca, choose a plan/network – UC 
SHIP PPO, which lists the Physicians, Providers, and Facilities that participate in this Plan’s network.

• Contact Member Services to request a list of Physicians and Providers that participate in this Plan’s 
network, based on specialty and geographic area.
• Check with your Physician or Provider.
Please note that not all Network Providers offer all services. For example, some hospital-based labs are 
not part of our Reference Lab Network. In those cases, you will have to go to a lab in the Reference Lab 
Network to get Network benefits. Please call Member Services before you get services for more 
information.
If you need details about a Provider’s license or training, or help choosing a Physician who is right for 
you, call the Member Services number on the back of your Member Identification Card (1-866-940-8306).

Administrator to help with your needs.
Please note that Anthem has several networks, please make sure to choose the UC SHIP PPO network 
when choosing a provider.
Timely Access to Care
Anthem has contracted with health care service providers to provide Covered Services in a manner 
appropriate for your condition, consistent with good professional practice. Anthem ensures that its 
contracted provider networks have the capacity and availability to offer appointments within the following 
timeframes:
22
• Urgent Care appointments for services that do not require prior authorization: within forty-eight 
(48) hours of the request for an appointment;
• Urgent Care appointments for services that require prior authorization: within ninety-six (96) 
hours of the request for an appointment;
• Non-Urgent appointments for primary care: within ten (10) business days of the request for an 
appointment;
• Non-Urgent appointments with specialists: within fifteen (15) business days of the request for an 
appointment;
If a Provider determines that the waiting time for an appointment can be extended without a 
detrimental impact on your health, the Provider may schedule an appointment for a later time than 
noted above.
Anthem arranges for telephone triage or screening services for you twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven 
(7) days per week with a waiting time of no more than thirty (30) minutes. If Anthem contracts with a 
Provider for telephone triage or screening services, the Provider will utilize a telephone answering machine 
and/or an answering service and/or office staff, during and after business hours, to inform you of the wait 
time for a return call from the Provider or how the Member may obtain urgent care or Emergency services
or how to contact another Provider who is on-call for telephone triage or screening services.
If you need the services of an interpreter, the services will be coordinated with scheduled appointments 
and will not result in a delay of an appointment with a Network Provider.
The BlueCard Program 
Like all Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans throughout the country, the Claims Administrator participates in 
a program called “BlueCard,” which provides services to you when you are outside the Service Area. For 
more details on this program, please see “Inter-Plan Arrangements” in the “Claims Payment” section.
Identification Card
A health app is available that allows UC SHIP Members and their Dependents to access Plan 
Identification Cards and benefits information from their mobile devices. To learn more about these 
services, or if you would like to order a hardcopy of your ID Card, please call UC SHIP Member Services 
at 1-866-940-8306 or download the Sydney Health app from the App Store or Google play or visit 
www.anthem.com/ca . Once you have the app, follow these steps to register:
• Select “Student ID” from the Identification drop down box, enter your student ID number, date of 
birth (mm/dd/yyyy), first name, last name; then go to the next screen.
• On the next screen, you will be prompted to select two security questions and a password. 
The Claims Administrator will provide an electronic Identification Card to each Member enrolled in the 
Plan. When you get care, you must show your Identification Card. Only covered Members have the right 
to receive services under this Plan. If anyone gets services or benefits to which they are not entitled to 
under the terms of this Benefit Booklet, he/she must pay for the actual cost of the services.
You may not knowingly permit the use of your Plan Identification Card by someone other than yourself or 
your dependents to obtain services.
23
Schedule of Benefits 
In this section you will find an outline of the benefits included in your Plan and a summary of any 
Deductibles, Coinsurance, and Copayments that you must pay. Also listed are any Benefit Year Maximums 
or limits that apply. Please read the "What’s Covered" for more details on the Plan’s Covered Services. 
Read the “What’s Not Covered” section for details on Excluded Services.
All Covered Services are subject to the conditions, exclusions, limitations, and terms of this Benefit Booklet
including any endorsements, amendments, or riders.
To get the highest benefits at the lowest out-of-pocket cost, you must get Covered Services from a 
UC Family or Network Provider. Benefits for Covered Services are based on the Maximum Allowed 
Amount, which is the most the Plan will allow for a Covered Service. Except for Surprise Billing Claims, 
when you use an Out-of-Network Provider you may have to pay the difference between the Out-of-Network 
Provider’s billed charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount in addition to any Coinsurance, Copayments, 
Deductibles, and non-covered charges. This amount can be substantial. Please read the “Claims Payment” 
section for more details.
Certain services require prior authorization in order for benefits to be provided. UC Family and Network 
Providers will initiate the review on your behalf. An Out-of-Network Provider may or may not initiate the 
review for you. In both cases, it is your responsibility to initiate the process and ask your Physician to 
request prior authorization. You may also call Anthem directly. Please see “Getting Approval for Benefits” 
for more details.
Deductibles, Coinsurance, and Benefit Year Maximums are calculated based upon the Maximum Allowed 
Amount, not the Provider’s billed charges.
Essential Health Benefits provided within this Benefit Booklet are not subject to lifetime or annual 
dollar maximums. Certain non-essential health benefits, however, are subject to either a lifetime 
and/or dollar maximum.
Essential Health Benefits are defined by federal law and refer to benefits in at least the following 
categories:
• Ambulatory patient services,
• Emergency services,
• Hospitalization,
• Maternity and newborn care,
• Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder services, including behavioral health treatment,
• Prescription drugs,
• Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices,
• Laboratory services,

plus the difference between the Out-of-Network Provider’s billed charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount. 
Note: The Coinsurance listed above may not apply to all benefits, and some benefits may have a different 
Coinsurance. For example, the coinsurance for ambulance services and psycho-educational testing are based 
upon billed charges. Please see the rest of this Schedule for details.
25

Coinsurance, and Copayments you pay during a Benefit Year, including Coinsurance and Copayments at the 
Student Health Center unless otherwise indicated below. It does not include charges over the Maximum 
Allowed Amount or amounts you pay for non-Covered Services. It does not include penalties for not getting 
required Precertification.

Copayments for the rest of the Benefit Year.
The UC Family, Network and Out-of-Network Out-of-Pocket Limits are separate and do not apply toward each
other.
Note: Any Copayments or Coinsurance you pay toward your prescription drug benefit will apply towards your

Services number on the back of your ID card or access Anthem’s website at www.anthem.com/ca.
26
Important Notice about Your Cost Shares
For certain Covered Services, and depending on your Plan design, you may be required to pay all or a part 
of the Maximum Allowed Amount as your cost share amount (Deductibles, Coinsurance or Copayments). 
Your cost share amount may be different depending on whether you received Covered Services from a 
Network Provider (including a UC Family Provider) or Out-of-Network Provider. Specifically, you may be 
required to pay higher cost-share amounts or may have limits on your benefits when using Out-of-Network 
Providers. Please see the “Schedule of Benefits” section for your cost share responsibilities and limitations 
or call the Member Services telephone number (1-866-940-8306) on your Identification Card to learn how 
this Plan’s benefits or cost share amount may vary by the type of Provider you use.
The Claims Administrator will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You may be 
responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether 
such services are performed by a Network Provider or Out-of-Network Provider. Non-Covered Services
include services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of your Plan and services received after 
benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, Medical Benefit 
Maximums or day/visit limits.
In some instances, you may only be asked to pay the lower Network Provider cost share percentage when 
you use an Out-of-Network Provider. For example, if you go to a Network Hospital or Facility and receive 
Covered Services from an Out-of-Network Provider such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist 
providing services at the Hospital or Facility, you will pay the Network Provider cost share percentage of 
the Maximum Allowed Amount for those Covered Services. However, you also may be liable for the 
difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out-of-Network Provider’s charge, called 
“Balance Billing.” (Please see above exceptions for Out-of-Network Services and Benefits.)
Emergency Services Provided by Out-of-Network Providers. Out-of-Network Providers may send 
you a bill and collect the amount of the Out-of-Network Provider’s charge that exceeds the Maximum 
Allowed Amount under this Plan. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum 
Allowed Amount and the amount the Out-of-Network Provider charges. This amount can be significant. 
If you receive a bill, please contact your campus student health center insurance office at 1-949-824-
5301 for additional information or assistance. Covered Dependents must contact the Claims 
Administrator at 1-866-940-8306, as listed on their Identification Card, for additional information or 
assistance.
Reduction of The Maximum Allowed Amount for Non-Contracting Hospitals. A small percentage 
of hospitals which are Out-of-Network Providers are also Non-Contracting Hospitals. Except for 
Emergency care, the Maximum Allowed Amount is reduced by 25% for all services and supplies 
provided by a Non-Contracting Hospital. You will be responsible for paying this amount. You are strongly 
encouraged to avoid this additional expense by seeking care from a Contracting Hospital. You can call 
Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 to locate a Contracting Hospital.
The tables below outline the Plan’s Covered Services and the cost share(s) you must pay. In many spots 
you will see the statement, “Benefits are based on the setting in which Covered Services are received.” In 
these cases, you should determine where you will receive the service (i.e., in a Doctor’s office, at an 
outpatient Hospital Facility, etc.) and look up that location to find out which cost share will apply. For 
example, you might get physical therapy in a Doctor’s office, an outpatient Hospital Facility, or during an 
Inpatient Hospital stay. For services in the office, look up “Office Visits.” For services in the outpatient 
department of a hospital, look up “Outpatient Facility Services.” For services during an Inpatient stay, look 
up “Inpatient Services.” 
Note: Student Health Center is a UC Family provider that provides many although not all of the covered 
services outlined in the tables below. For a detailed listing of the services provided at Student Health Center,

Human Organ and Tissue Transplant (Bone Marrow / Stem Cell) Services
Please call the Transplant Department at 1-800-824-0581 as soon as you think you may need a 
transplant to talk about your benefit options. You must do this before you have an evaluation and/or 
work-up for a transplant. To get the most benefits under your Plan, you must get certain human organ 
and tissue transplant services from the Centers of Medical Excellence (CME), Blue Distinction Centers 
for Specialty Care (BDCSC) or a UC Family Provider. 
The Claims Administrator provides access to Centers of Medical Excellence (CME) networks and Blue 
Distinction Centers for Specialty Care (BDCSC). Even if a Hospital is a Network Provider for other services, it 
may not be a Network Transplant Provider for certain transplant services. These procedures are covered 
only when performed at a CME, BDCSC or by a UC Family Provider. 
Please call to find out which Hospitals are Network Transplant Providers. (When calling Member Services, ask 
for the Transplant Case Manager for further details.)
The facilities included in each of these networks are selected to provide the following specified medical 
services:
• Transplant facilities have been organized to provide services for the following specified transplants: heart, 
liver, lung, combination heart-lung, kidney, pancreas, simultaneous pancreas-kidney, or bone marrow/stem 
cell and similar procedures. Subject to any applicable co-payments or deductibles, CME and BDCSC have 
agreed to a rate they will accept as payment in full for Covered Services. These procedures are covered 
only when performed at a CME, BDCSC or by a UC Family provider.
The requirements described below do not apply to the following:
• Cornea transplants, which are covered as any other surgery; and
• Any Covered Services related to a Covered Transplant Procedure that you get before or after the Transplant 
Benefit Period. Please note that the initial evaluation, any added tests to determine your eligibility as a 
candidate for a transplant by your Provider, and the collection and storage of bone marrow/stem cells is 
included in the Covered Transplant Procedure benefit regardless of the date of service.
Benefits for Covered Services that are not part of the Human Organ and Tissue Transplant benefit will be based 
on the setting in which Covered Services are received. Please see the “What’s Covered” section for additional 
details.

Getting Approval for Benefits
Most services require a Referral from the Student Health Center before seeking care off campus, except 
for Emergency care, urgent care, LiveHealth Online, pediatric dental or vision for members under age 19, 
services of a pediatrician, obstetrician, gynecologist, or during winter break. Your Plan also includes the 
process of Utilization Review to decide when services are Medically Necessary or 
Experimental/Investigational as those terms are defined in this Benefit Booklet. Utilization Review aids the 
delivery of cost-effective health care by reviewing the use of treatments and, when proper, level of care 
and/or the setting or place of service that they are performed. 
Reviewing Where Services Are Provided
A service must be Medically Necessary to be a Covered Service. When level of care, setting or place of 
service is part of the review, services that can be safely given to you in a lower level of care or lower cost 
setting / place of care, will not be Medically Necessary if they are given in a higher level of care, or higher 
cost setting / place of care. This means that a request for a service may be denied because it is not 
Medically Necessary for the service to be provided where it is being requested. When this happens, the 
service can be requested again in another place and will be reviewed again for Medical Necessity. At 
times a different provider or facility may need to be used in order for the service to be considered 
Medically Necessary. Examples include, but are not limited to:
• A service may be denied on an inpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable if provided on 
an outpatient basis at a Hospital.
• A service may be denied on an outpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable at a free 
standing imaging center, infusion center, Ambulatory Surgery Center, or in a Physician’s office.
• A service may be denied at a Skilled Nursing Facility but may be approvable in a home setting.
Utilization Review criteria will be based on many sources including medical policy and clinical guidelines. 
Anthem may decide that a treatment that was asked for is not Medically Necessary if a clinically 
equivalent treatment that is more cost effective is available and appropriate. “Clinically equivalent” means 
treatments that for most Members, will give you similar results for a disease or condition.
If you have any questions about the information in this section, you may call the UC SHIP Member Services
at 1-866-940-8306.
Coverage for or payment of the service or treatment reviewed is not guaranteed even if it's decided 
your services are Medically Necessary. For benefits to be covered, on the date you get service:
1. You must be eligible for benefits;
2. Premium must be paid for the time period that services are given;
3. The service or supply must be a Covered Service under your Plan;
4. The service cannot be subject to an Exclusion under your Plan; and
5. You must not have exceeded any applicable limits under your Plan.
56
Types of Reviews
• Pre-service Review – A review of a service, treatment or admission for a coverage determination 
which is done before the service or treatment begins or admission date.
− Precertification – A required Pre-service Review, for a benefit coverage determination for a 
service or treatment. Certain services require Precertification in order for you to get benefits. The 
benefit coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of 
Medical Necessity or is Experimental / Investigational as those terms are defined in this Benefit 
Booklet. 
For admission following Emergency Care, you, your authorized representative, or Doctor must 
notify the Claims Administrator within 72 hours of the admission or as soon as possible, within a 
reasonable period of time. For labor/ childbirth admissions, Precertification is not needed unless 
there is a problem and/or the mother and baby are not sent home at the same time. Precertification 
is not required for the first 48 hours for a vaginal delivery or 96 hours for a cesarean section. 
Admissions longer than 48/96 hours require precertification.
− Predetermination – An optional, voluntary Review request for a benefit coverage determination 
for a service or treatment if there is a related clinical coverage guideline. The benefit coverage 
review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical 
Necessity or is Experimental / Investigational as those terms are defined in this Benefit Booklet. 
• Continued Stay / Concurrent Review – A Utilization Review of a service, treatment or admission for 
a benefit coverage determination which must be done during an ongoing stay in a Facility or course of 
treatment.
Both Pre-service and Continued Stay / Concurrent Reviews may be considered urgent when, in the view 
of the treating Provider or any Doctor with knowledge of your medical condition, without such care or 
treatment, your life or health or your ability to regain maximum function could be seriously threatened or 
you could be subjected to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without such care or 
treatment. Urgent reviews are conducted under a shorter timeframe than standard reviews.
• Post-service Review – A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage that is 
conducted after the service has been provided. Post-service Reviews are performed when a service, 
treatment or admission did not need a Precertification, or when a needed Precertification was not 
obtained, or a Predetermination review was not performed. Post-service Reviews are done for a 
service, treatment, or admission in which the Claims Administrator has a related clinical coverage 
guideline and are typically initiated by the Claims Administrator.
Services for which Precertification is required (i.e., services that need to be reviewed by the Claims 
Administrator to determine whether they are Medically Necessary) include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
1. Admissions to a Skilled Nursing Facility if you require daily skilled nursing or rehabilitation, as certified 
by your attending Physician.
2. Air ambulance services for non-Emergency Hospital to Hospital transfers.
3. Certain non-Emergency ground ambulance services
4. Bariatric surgical services, such as gastric bypass and other surgical procedures for weight loss, 
including bariatric travel expense if:
a. The services are to be performed for the treatment of morbid obesity;
57
b. The physicians on the surgical team and the facility in which the surgical procedure is to take place 
are approved for the surgical procedure requested; and
c. The bariatric surgical procedure will be performed at a BDCSC facility or by a UC Family Provider.
5. Behavioral health treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorders.
6. Fertility Preservation and related Covered Services. 
7. Home health care. The following criteria must be met:
a. The services can be safely provided in your home, as certified by your attending Physician;
b. Your attending Physician manages and directs your medical care at home; and
c. Your attending Physician has established a definitive treatment plan which must be consistent with 
your medical needs and lists the services to be provided by the Home Health Care Agency.
8. Scheduled, non-emergency inpatient Hospital stays and Residential Treatment Center admissions.
Exceptions: Utilization review is not required for Inpatient Hospital stays for the following services:
a. Maternity care of 48 hours or less following a normal delivery or 96 hours or less following a 
cesarean section; and
b. Mastectomy in association with a breast cancer diagnosis and lymph node dissection.
9. Services of a home infusion therapy provider if the attending Physician has submitted both a 
prescription and a plan of treatment before services are rendered.
10. Gender Affirming surgery benefits and related Covered Services will be provided as follows: 
a. The Surgical Procedure:
− The services are Medically Necessary and appropriate; and
− The physicians on the surgical team and the facility in which the surgery is to take place are 
approved for the gender affirming surgery requested.
− Precertification is required for certain service.
b. Gender Affirming Surgery Travel Expense:
− It is for gender affirming surgery and related services, authorized by the Claims Administrator; 
and
− The gender affirming surgery must be performed at a specific facility designated by the Claims 
Administrator which is approved for the gender affirming surgery requested.
11. Transplant services including transplant travel expense. The following criteria must be met for certain
transplants, as follows:
a. For bone, skin, or cornea transplants, if the physicians on the surgical team and the facility in which 
the transplant is to take place are approved for the transplant requested.
b. For transplantation of heart, liver, lung, combination heart-lung, kidney, pancreas, simultaneous 
pancreas-kidney or bone marrow/stem cell and similar procedures, if the providers of the related 
preoperative and postoperative services are approved and the transplant will be performed at a 
Centers of Medical Excellence (CME), Blue Distinction Centers for Specialty Care (BDCSC) facility 
or by a UC Family Provider.
58
Who is Responsible for Precertification?
Typically, Network Providers know which services need Precertification and will get any Precertification 
when needed or ask for a Predetermination, even though it is not required. Your Primary Care Physician 
and other Network Providers have been given detailed information about these procedures and they are 
responsible for meeting these requirements. If services are requested at an out-of-network, nonparticipating provider, or Blue Card provider, you are responsible to obtain the Precertification. When you 
are travelling abroad and need medical care, you can call Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service 
Center any time. 
They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Generally, the ordering Provider, Facility or 
attending Doctor (“requesting Provider”) will get in touch with the Claims Administrator to ask for a 
Precertification or Predetermination review. 
However, you may request a Precertification, Predetermination, or you may choose an authorized 
representative to act on your behalf for a specific request. The authorized representative can be anyone 
who is 18 years of age or older. The table below outlines who is responsible for Precertification and under 
what circumstances.

How Decisions Regarding Medical Necessity are Made
The Claims Administrator will use clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy, clinical guidelines, 
and other applicable policies to help make Medical Necessity decisions. Medical policies and clinical 
guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions identified as proper medical practice. 
The Claims Administrator reserves the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines from 
time to time.
You are entitled to ask for and get, free of charge, reasonable access to any records concerning your 
request. To ask for this information, call the Precertification phone number at 1-800-274-7767, which also 
appears on the back of your Identification Card. You can also find our medical policies on our website at 
www.anthem.com.
If you are not satisfied with the Claims Administrator's decision under this section of your benefits, please 
refer to the "Your Right to Appeals" section to see what rights may be available to you.
Decision and Notification Requirements
The Claims Administrator will review requests for benefits according to the timeframes listed below. The 
timeframes and requirements listed are based on federal regulations. You may call 1-866-940-8306 for 
additional information. 
Type of Review Timeframe Requirement for Decision and 
Notification
Urgent Pre-service Review 72 hours from the receipt of request
Non-Urgent Pre-service Review 15 calendar days from the receipt of the request
Urgent Concurrent / Continued Stay Review 
when request is received more than 24

If more information is needed to make their decision, the Claims Administrator will tell the requesting 
Provider of the specific information needed to finish the review. If Claims Administrator does not get the 
specific information needed by the required timeframe, a decision will be made based upon the information 
received. 
The Claims Administrator will give notice to you and your Provider of its decision as required by state and 
federal regulations. Notice may be given by one or more of the following methods: verbal, written, and/or 
electronic.
Important Information
The Claims Administrator may, from time to time, waive, enhance, change, or end certain medical 
management processes (including utilization management, case management, and disease management) 
and/or offer an alternate benefit if in its sole discretion, such change furthers the provision of cost effective, 
value based and/or quality services.
The Claims Administrator may also select certain qualifying Providers to take part in a program or a provider 
arrangement that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would 
otherwise apply. The Claims Administrator may also exempt your claim from medical review if certain 
conditions apply.
Just because the Claims Administrator exempts a process, Provider or Claim from the standards which 
otherwise would apply, it does not mean that the Claims Administrator will do so in the future or will do so 
in the future for any other Provider, claim or Member. The Claims Administrator may stop or change any 
such exemption with or without advance notice.
You may find out whether a Provider is taking part in certain programs by contacting the Member Services 
number at1-866-940-8306, which is indicated on the back of your Identification Card.
The Claims Administrator also may identify certain Providers to review for potential fraud, waste, abuse or 
other inappropriate activity if the claims data suggests there may be inappropriate billing practices. If a 
Provider is selected under this program, then the Claims Administrator may use one or more clinical 
utilization management guidelines in the review of claims submitted by this Provider, even if those 
guidelines are not used for all Providers delivering services to this Plan’s Members.
Health Plan Individual Case Management
Our health plan individual case management programs (Case Management) help coordinate services for 
Members with health care needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic health conditions. The Claims 
Administrator’s programs coordinate benefits and educate Members who agree to take part in the Case 
Management Program to help meet their health-related needs. 
Case Management programs are confidential and voluntary and are made available at no extra cost to you. 
These programs are provided by, or on behalf of and at the request of, your health plan case management 
staff. These Case Management programs are separate from any Covered Services you are receiving.
If you meet program criteria and agree to take part in, the Claims Administrator will help you meet your 
identified health care needs. This is reached through contact and teamwork with you and/or your chosen 
authorized representative, treating Physician(s), and other Providers. 
In addition, the Claims Administrator may assist with coordinating care with existing community-based 
programs and services to meet your needs. This may include giving you information about external 
agencies and community-based programs and services.
61
In certain cases of severe or chronic illness or injury, the Plan may provide benefits for alternate care that 
is not listed as a Covered Service. The Plan may also extend Covered Services beyond the Benefit Year 
Maximums of this Plan. The Claims Administrator will make its decision case-by-case, if in the Claims 
Administrator’s discretion, the alternate or extended benefit is in the best interest of you and the Plan, and 
you or your authorized representative agree to the alternate or extended benefit in writing. A decision to 
provide extended benefits or approve alternate care in one case does not obligate the Plan to provide the 
same benefits again to you or to any other Member. The Plan reserves the right, at any time, to alter or 
stop providing extended benefits or approving alternate care. In such case, the Claims Administrator will 
notify you or your authorized representative in writing.
62
What’s Covered
This section describes the Covered Services available under your Plan. Your Covered Services are subject 
to all the terms and conditions listed in this Benefit Booklet, including, but not limited to, Benefit Maximums, 
Deductibles, Copayments, Coinsurance, exclusions and Medical Necessity requirements. Please refer to 
the "Schedule of Benefits" for details on the amounts you are required to pay for Covered Services and for 
details on any Benefit Maximums. Also be sure to refer to the "How Your Plan Works" section for additional 
information on your Plan’s rules. Read the “What’s Not Covered” section for important details on Excluded 
Services.
Your benefits are described below. Benefits are listed alphabetically to make them easy to find. Please
note that several sections may apply to your claims. For example, if you have a surgery, benefits for your 
Hospital stay will be described under "Hospital Services" and benefits for your Physician’s services will be 
described under "Physician’s Services." As a result, you should review all benefit descriptions that might 
apply to your claims. 
You should also be aware that many of the Covered Services can be received in several settings, including 
a Physician’s office or your home, an Urgent Care Facility, an Outpatient Facility, or an Inpatient Facility. 
Benefits will often vary depending on where and from whom you choose to receive Covered Services, and 
this can result in a change in the amount you will need to pay. Please see the “Schedule of Benefits” for 
more details. 
Acupuncture
Please see “Therapy Services” later in this section.
Allergy Services
Your Plan includes benefits for Medically Necessary allergy testing and treatment, including allergy serum 
and allergy shots. 
Ambulance Services
Medically Necessary ambulance services are a Covered Service as described in this section when you 
are transported by a state licensed vehicle that is designed, equipped, and used only to transport the sick 
and injured and staffed by Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), paramedics, or other certified medical 
professionals. Ambulance services include medical and mental health Medically Necessary nonEmergency ambulance transportation, including psychiatric transportation for safety issues. Ambulance 
Services do not include transportation by car, taxi, bus, gurney van, wheelchair van and any other type of 
transportation (other than a licensed ambulance), even if it is the only way to travel to a Provider
Ambulance services are a Covered Service when one or more of the following criteria are met:
• For ground ambulance, you are taken:
− From your home, scene of accident or medical Emergency to a Hospital;
- Between Hospitals, including when the Claims Administrator requires you to move from an Outof-Network Hospital to an In-Network Hospital; or
-
- Between a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility or other approved Facility.
• For air or water ambulance, you are taken:
- From the scene of an accident or medical Emergency to a Hospital;
63
- Between Hospitals, including when the Claims Administrator requires you to move from an Outof-Network Hospital to an In-Network Hospital; or
- Between a Hospital and an approved Facility.
Non-Emergency ambulance services are subject to Medical Necessity reviews by us. Emergency 
ground ambulance services do not require Precertification and are allowed regardless of whether the 
Provider is an In-Network or Out-of-Network Provider.
When using an air ambulance for non-Emergency transportation, we reserve the right to select the air 
ambulance Provider. If you do not use the air ambulance Provider we select, the Out-of-Network 
Provider may bill you for any charges that exceed the Plan’s Maximum Allowed Amount. 
You must be taken to the nearest Facility that can give care for your condition. In certain circumstances 
the Claims Administrator may approve benefits for transportation to a Facility that is not the nearest 
Facility.
Benefits also include Medically Necessary treatment of a sickness or injury by medical professionals from 
an ambulance service, even if you are not taken to a Facility.
Ambulance services are not covered when another type of transportation can be used without 
endangering your health. Ambulance services for your convenience or the convenience of your family or 
Doctor are not a Covered Service.
Other non-covered ambulance services include, but are not limited to, trips to:
a) A Doctor’s office or clinic;
b) A morgue or funeral home.
If provided through the 911 emergency response system, ambulance charges are covered if it is 
reasonably believed that a medical Emergency existed even if you are not transported to a Hospital. 
Payment of benefits for ambulance services may be made directly to the Provider of service unless proof 
of payment is received by us prior to the benefits being paid.
IN SOME AREAS A 911 EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. THIS 
SYSTEM IS TO BE USED ONLY WHEN THERE IS AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION THAT 
REQUIRES AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE.
IF YOU REASONABLY BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING AN EMERGENCY, YOU SHOULD 
CALL 911 OR GO DIRECTLY TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM.
Important Notes on Air Ambulance Benefits
Benefits are only available for air ambulance when it is not appropriate to use a ground or water ambulance. 
For example, if using a ground ambulance would endanger your health and your medical condition requires 
a more rapid transport to a Facility than the ground ambulance can provide, the Plan will cover the air 
ambulance. Air ambulance will also be covered if you are in an area that a ground or water ambulance 
cannot reach. 
Air ambulance will not be covered if you are taken to a hospital that is not an acute care hospital (such as 
a skilled nursing facility or a rehabilitation facility), or if you are taken to a physician’s office or to your 
home.
64
Hospital to Hospital Transport
If you are moving from one Hospital to another, air ambulance will only be covered if using a ground 
ambulance would endanger your health and if the Hospital that first treats cannot give you the medical 
services you need. Certain specialized services are not available at all Hospitals. For example, burn care, 
cardiac care, trauma care, and critical care are only available at certain Hospitals. To be covered, you must 
be taken to the closest Hospital that can treat you. Coverage is not available for air ambulance transfers 
simply because you, your family, or your Provider prefers a specific Hospital or Physician. 
Nonemergency: UC SHIP covers nonemergency ambulance and psychiatric transport van services if a 
Physician determines that your condition requires the use of services that only a licensed ambulance (or 
psychiatric transport van) can provide and that the use of other means of transportation would endanger 
your health. These services are covered only when the vehicle transports you to and from covered services.
Ambulance Services exclusion: Transportation by car, taxi, bus, gurney van, and any other type of 
transportation (other than a licensed ambulance or psychiatric transport van), even if it is the only way to 
travel to a covered service.

your dentist should submit your treatment plan to the Claims Administrator before you start any 
orthodontic treatment to make sure it is covered under this Plan.
72
Medically Necessary Orthodontic Care
Medically Necessary services will be subject to review. To be considered Medically Necessary, the 
service must meet criteria for Medically Necessary care as established by the Claims Administrator. The 
Plan will cover orthodontic care when it is Medically Necessary to prevent disease and promote oral 
health, restore oral structures to health and function, and treat Emergency and urgent conditions.
Your dental provider should submit a prior authorization form to Anthem for this service. This form is 
available by calling the telephone number listed on your Identification Card or online at 
www.anthem.com/ca. You may call Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 to ask that a prior authorization 
form be faxed to your dentist.
The prior authorization process is outlined below:
• The Dental Professional Review area handles the review.
• If the Anthem defined criteria is met, the Dental Professional Review area will communicate to the 
dentist and Insured about the approval.
• If the Anthem defined criteria is NOT met, the Dental Professional Review area will communicate to 
the dentist and Insured about the denial.
• The letters of response contain steps for additional review, including information about filing a 
grievance.
• If prior authorization is denied you have the right to file a grievance.
The following conditions automatically qualify for Medically Necessary orthodontic care.
• Cleft palate deformity. If the cleft palate is not visible on the diagnostic casts written documentation 
from a credentialed Specialist must be submitted, on his or her professional letterhead, with the prior 
authorization request.
• Craniofacial anomaly. Written documentation from a credentialed Specialist shall be submitted, on 
his or her professional letterhead, with the prior authorization request.
• Deep impinging overbite when the lower incisors are destroying the soft tissue of the palate and 
tissue laceration, or clinical attachment loss is present.
• Crossbite of individual anterior teeth when clinical attachment loss and recession of the gingival 
margin are present.

osteomyelitis, or other gross pathology. Written documentation of the condition must be submitted 
with the prior authorization request.
• Overjet greater than 9mm or mandibular protrusion (reverse overjet) greater than 3.5mm.
Orthodontic treatment may include the following: 
• Limited Treatment – Treatments which are not full treatment cases and are usually done for minor 
tooth movement
• Interceptive Treatment – A limited (phase I) treatment phase used to prevent or assist in the severity 
of future treatment
• Comprehensive (complete) Treatment – Full treatment includes all radiographs, diagnostic 
casts/models, appliances and visits
• Removable Appliance Therapy – An appliance that is removable and not cemented or bonded to the 
teeth
• Fixed Appliance Therapy – A component that is cemented or bonded to the teeth

73
Note: Treatment in progress (appliances placed prior to being covered under this Plan) will be considered 
for benefits on a pro-rated basis
What Orthodontic Care Does NOT Include. Coverage is NOT provided for:
• Monthly treatment visits that are billed separately — these costs should already be included in the 
cost of treatment
• Orthodontic retention or retainers that are billed separately — these costs should already be 
included in the cost of treatment
• Retreatment and services given due to a relapse
• Inpatient or Outpatient Hospital expenses, unless covered by the medical benefits of this Plan
• Any provisional splinting, temporary procedures or interim stabilization of the teeth.
Orthodontic Payments
Because orthodontic treatment normally occurs over a long period of time, payments are made over the 
course of your treatment. The covered individual must have continuous coverage under this Plan in order 
to receive ongoing payments for your orthodontic treatment.
Payments for treatment are made: 1. when treatment begins (appliances are installed), and 2. at six (6) 
month intervals thereafter, until treatment is completed, or this coverage ends.
Before treatment begins, the treating dentist should submit a pre-treatment estimate to us. An Estimate 
of Benefits form will be sent to you and your dentist indicating the estimated Maximum Allowed Amount, 
including any amount (Coinsurance) you may owe. This form serves as a claim form when treatment 
begins.
When treatment begins, the dentist should submit the Estimate of Benefit form with the date of appliance 
placement and his/her signature. After benefit and eligibility verification by us, a payment will be issued. 
A new/revised Estimate of Benefits form will also be issued to you and your dentist. This again will serve 
as the claim form to be submitted six (6) months from the date of appliance placement.
Timely Access to Dental Care
Anthem has contracted with dental Providers to provide covered services in a manner appropriate for 
Your condition, consistent with good professional practice. Anthem ensures that its network of contracted
