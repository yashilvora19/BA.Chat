Introduction
Dear Plan Member:
This Benefit Booklet gives you a description of your benefits while you and your eligible Dependents are
enrolled under the University of California Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) (the “Plan”) offered
by your University. You should read this Benefit Booklet carefully to get to know the Plan’s main provisions
and keep it handy for reference. A thorough understanding of your coverage will allow you to use your
benefits wisely. If you have any questions about the benefits shown in this Benefit Booklet, please call your
student health services or UC SHIP Member Services at 1-866-940-8306.
The Plan benefits described in this Benefit Booklet are for eligible Members only during the 2019-20 Plan
year. The health care services are subject to the limitations and exclusions, Copayments, Deductible, and
Coinsurance rules given in this Benefit Booklet.
Many words used in this Benefit Booklet have special meanings (e.g., Covered Services and Medical
Necessity). These words are capitalized and are defined in the "Definitions" section. See these definitions
for the best understanding of what is being stated. Throughout this Benefit Booklet you may also see
references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “you,” and “your.” The words “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Claims
Administrator. The words “you” and “your” mean the Member, Insured student and each covered
Dependent.
If you have any questions about your Plan, please be sure to call Member Services at 1-866-940-8306.
Also be sure to check the Claims Administrator’s website, www.anthem.com/ca for details on how to locate
a Provider, get answers to questions, and access valuable health and wellness tips.
Important: This is not an insured benefit plan. The benefits described in this Benefit Booklet or any rider
or amendments attached hereto are funded by the University of California Student Health Insurance Plan
who is responsible for their payment. Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health (the Claims Administrator)
provides administrative claims payment services only and does not assume any financial risk or obligation
with respect to claims.
Your University has agreed to be subject to the terms and conditions of Anthem’s provider agreement which
may include Pre-service Review and utilization management requirements, coordination of benefits, timely
filing limits, and other requirements to administer the benefits under this Plan.
Anthem is an independent corporation operating under a license from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association, permitting Anthem to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Marks in the State of
California. Although Anthem is the Claims Administrator and is licensed in California you will have access
to providers participating in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association BlueCard® PPO network across
the country. Anthem has entered into a contract with UC SHIP on its own behalf and not as the agent of
the Association.

Your Right to Appeals
For purposes of these Appeal provisions, “claim for benefits” means a request for benefits under the Plan.
The term includes both pre-service and post-service claims.
• A pre-service claim is a claim for benefits under the Plan for which you have not received the benefit
or for which you may need to obtain approval in advance.
• A post-service claim is any other claim for benefits under the Plan for which you have received the
service.
If your claim is denied:
• You will be provided with a written notice of the denial; and
• You are entitled to a full and fair review of the denial.
The procedure the Claims Administrator will follow will satisfy the requirements for a full and fair review
under applicable federal regulations.
Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination
If your claim is denied, the Claims Administrator’s notice of the adverse benefit determination (denial) will
include:
• information sufficient to identify the claim involved;
• the specific reason(s) for the denial;
• a reference to the specific Plan provision(s) on which the Claims Administrator’s determination is
based;
• a description of any additional material or information needed to perfect your claim;
• an explanation of why the additional material or information is needed;
• a description of the Plan’s review procedures and the time limits that apply to them
• information about any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion relied upon in making
the claim determination and about your right to request a copy of it free of charge, along with a
discussion of the claims denial decision;
• information about the scientific or clinical judgment for any determination based on Medical Necessity
or experimental treatment, or about your right to request this explanation free of charge, along with a
discussion of the claims denial decision; and
• the availability of, and contact information for, any applicable office of health insurance consumer
assistance or ombudsman who may assist you.
For claims involving urgent/concurrent care:
• the Claims Administrator’s notice will also include a description of the applicable urgent/concurrent
review process; and
• the Claims Administrator’s may notify you or your authorized representative within 24 hours orally and
then furnish a written notification.
3
Appeals (Grievances)
You have the right to appeal an adverse benefit determination (claim denial). You or your authorized
representative must file your appeal within 180 calendar days after you are notified of the denial. You will
have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information supporting
your claim. The Claims Administrator’s review of your claim will take into account all information you submit,
regardless of whether it was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.
The Claims Administrator shall offer a single mandatory level of appeal and an additional voluntary second
level of appeal which may be a panel review, independent review, or other process consistent with the
entity reviewing the appeal. The time frame allowed for the Claims Administrator to complete its review is
dependent upon the type of review involved (e.g. pre-service, concurrent, post-service, urgent, etc.).
For pre-service claims involving urgent/concurrent care, you may obtain an expedited appeal. You or
your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary information, including the
Claims Administrator’s decision, can be sent between the Claims Administrator and you by telephone,
facsimile or other similar method. To file an appeal for a claim involving urgent/concurrent care, you or
your authorized representative must contact the Claims Administrator at 1-866-940-8306 and provide at
least the following information:
• the identity of the claimant;
• the date (s) of the medical service;
• the specific medical condition or symptom;
• the provider’s name;
• the service or supply for which approval of benefits was sought; and
• any reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis.
All other requests for appeals should be submitted in writing by the Member or the Member’s authorized
representative, except where the acceptance of oral Appeals (Grievances) is otherwise required by the
nature of the appeal (e.g. urgent care). You or your authorized representative must submit a request for
review to:
Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company
ATTN: Appeals
P.O. Box 4310, Woodland Hills, CA 91365-4310
You must include your Member Identification Number when submitting an appeal.
Upon request, the Claims Administrator will provide, without charge, reasonable access to, and copies of,
all documents, records, and other information relevant to your claim. “Relevant” means that the document,
record, or other information:
• was relied on in making the benefit determination; or
• was submitted, considered, or produced in the course of making the benefit determination; or
• demonstrates compliance with processes and safeguards to ensure that claim determinations are made
in accordance with the terms of the Plan, applied consistently for similarly-situated claimants; or
• is a statement of the Plan’s policy or guidance about the treatment or benefit relative to your diagnosis.
The Claims Administrator will also provide you, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence
considered, relied upon, or generated in connection with your claim. In addition, before you receive an
adverse benefit determination on review based on a new or additional rationale, the Claims Administrator
will provide you, free of charge, with the rationale.
4
For Out of State Appeals (Grievances)
You have to file Provider Appeals with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan in that geographic area
(“Host Blue”). This means Providers must file Appeals with the same plan to which the claim was filed.
Eligibility (Grievances)
Grievances relating to eligibility for coverage under the Plan should be submitted to your campus student
health insurance office in writing, within 60 days of the notification that you are not eligible for coverage.
You should include all information and documentation on which your grievance is based. The student
health insurance office will notify you in writing of its conclusion regarding your eligibility. If the student
health insurance office confirms the determination that you are ineligible, you may request, in writing, that
the University of California Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) office review this decision. Your
request for review should be sent within 60 days after receipt of the notice from the student health insurance
office confirming your ineligibility and should include all information and documentation relevant to your
grievance. Your request for review should be submitted to: University of California Student Health
Insurance Plan, Risk Services, 1111 Franklin Street, 10th Floor, Oakland, CA 94607. The decision of the
UC SHIP Director will be final.
How Your Appeal will be Decided
When the Claims Administrator considers your appeal, the Claims Administrator’s review will not rely upon
the initial benefit determination (claim denial). The review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer
who did not make the initial determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial
determination.
An additional voluntary second-level review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer who did not make
the initial determination or the first-level appeal determination and who does not work for the person who
made the initial determination or first-level appeal determination.
If the denial was based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, including whether the treatment is
experimental, investigational, or not Medically Necessary, the reviewer will consult with a health care
professional who has the appropriate training and experience in the medical field involved in making the
judgment. This health care professional will not be one who was consulted in making an earlier
determination or who works for the health care professional who was consulted in making an earlier
determination.
Notification of the Outcome of the Appeal
If you appeal a claim involving urgent/concurrent care, the Claims Administrator will notify you of the
outcome of the appeal as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of your request for
appeal.
If you appeal any other pre-service claim, the Claims Administrator will notify you of the outcome of the
appeal within 30 days after receipt of your request for appeal.
If you appeal a post-service claim, the Claims Administrator will notify you of the outcome of the appeal
within 60 days after receipt of your request for appeal.
5
Appeal Denial
If your appeal is denied, that denial will be considered an adverse benefit determination. The notification
from the Claims Administrator will include all of the information set forth in the above subsection entitled
“Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination.”
Voluntary Second Level Appeals
If you are dissatisfied with the Plan's mandatory first level appeal decision, a voluntary second level appeal
may be available. If you would like to initiate a second level appeal, please write to the Anthem Blue Cross
address listed above. Voluntary appeals (Grievances) must be submitted within 60 calendar days of the
denial of the first level appeal. You are not required to complete a voluntary second level appeal prior to
submitting a request for an independent External Review.
External Review
If the outcome of the mandatory first level appeal is adverse to you and it was based on medical judgment,
you may be eligible for an independent External Review pursuant to federal law. You must submit your
request for External Review to the Claims Administrator within four (4) months of the notice of your final
internal adverse determination.
A request for an External Review must be in writing unless the Claims Administrator determines that it is
not reasonable to require a written statement. You do not have to re-send the information that you
submitted for internal appeal. However, you are encouraged to submit any additional information that you
think is important for review.
For pre-service claims involving urgent/concurrent care, you may proceed with an Expedited External
Review without filing an internal appeal or while simultaneously pursuing an expedited appeal through the
Claims Administrator’s internal appeal process. You or your authorized representative may request it orally
or in writing. All necessary information, including the Claims Administrator’s decision, can be sent between
the Claims Administrator and you by telephone, facsimile or other similar method. To proceed with an
Expedited External Review, you or your authorized representative must contact the Claims Administrator
at the phone number listed on your Identification Card (1-866-940-8306) and provide at least the following
information:
• the identity of the claimant;
• the date (s) of the medical service;
• the specific medical condition or symptom;
• the provider’s name;
• the service or supply for which approval of benefits was sought; and
• any reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis.
All other requests for External Review should be submitted in writing unless the Claims Administrator
determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement. Such requests should be submitted by
you or your authorized representative to:
Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company
ATTN: Appeals
P.O. Box 4310, Woodland Hills, CA 91365-4310
You must include your Member Identification number when submitting an appeal.
This is not an additional step that you must take in order to fulfill your appeal procedure obligations
described above. Your decision to seek External Review will not affect your rights to any other benefits
under this health care Plan. There is no charge for you to initiate an independent External Review. The
External Review decision is final and binding on all.
6
Requirement to file an Appeal before filing a lawsuit
If you are still dissatisfied with the resolution after you have completed the Appeals Procedure, you may
initiate proceedings in a court of law or other forum or file a claim in small claims court, depending on the
amount you are seeking. Any such action must be commenced within three years of the plan's final decision
on the claim or other request for benefits. If the Plan determines an appeal is untimely, the plan's latest
decision on the merits of the underlying claim or benefit request is the final decision date. You must exhaust
the plan's internal Appeals Procedure, other than voluntary level of appeal, before filing a lawsuit or taking
other legal action, including filing a claim in small claims court against the Plan.
The Claims Administrator reserves the right to modify the policies, procedures and timeframes in
this section in accordance with applicable law.

Eligibility and Enrollment – Adding Members
In this section you will find information on who is eligible for coverage under this Plan and when Members
can be added to your coverage. Eligibility requirements are described in general terms below. For more
specific information, please contact your student health services.
Eligible Status
The Insured Student
To be eligible to enroll, individual must be entitled to participate in the benefit Plan.
Insured Students
1. All registered domestic and international students at the University of California Merced campus,
including students who are registered in-absentia, are automatically enrolled in UC SHIP.
Note: A student may waive enrollment in the Plan during the specified waiver period by providing proof
of other coverage that meets benefit criteria specified by the University. A waiver is effective for one
academic year and must be completed again during the waiver period at the start of each fall term of the
academic year. Waiver requests for each academic term within a year are also available. Information
about waiving enrollment in the Plan may be obtained from the student health services.
Eligible Non-Registered Students
1. The following class of individuals may enroll voluntarily as Insured students:
a. All non-registered filing fee status graduate students of the University of California who are
completing work under the auspices of the University of California, as determined by the campus
but are not attending classes. Students on filing fee status may purchase Plan coverage for a
maximum of one semester or quarter by contacting AHP at 1-855-427-3209. The student must have
been covered by the Plan in the term immediately preceding the term for which the student wants
to purchase coverage or, if the student waived Plan enrollment, show proof of involuntary loss of the
coverage used to obtain the waiver.
b. All non-registered students of the University of California, as determined by the campus, who are on
a planned educational leave. While in this status, students may purchase Plan coverage for a
maximum of one semester. The student must have been covered by the Plan in the term
immediately preceding the term for which the student wants to purchase coverage or, if the student
waived Plan enrollment, show proof of involuntary loss of the coverage used to obtain the waiver.
These students may enroll by contacting AHP at 1-855-427-3209.
c. All former students of the University of California who recently completed their degree at UC
(graduated) during the term immediately preceding the term for which they want to purchase
coverage. Provided these individuals were enrolled in the Plan in the preceding term, they may
purchase the Plan coverage for a maximum of one semester. These individuals may enroll by
contacting AHP at 1-855-427-3209.
12
Dependents
Eligible Dependents
1. The following class of Dependents of Insured students may enroll voluntarily in the Plan:
• Spouse: Legally married spouse of the Insured student.
• Domestic Partner: The individual designated as an Insured student's Domestic Partner under one
of the following methods: (i) registration of the partnership with the State of California; (ii)
establishment of a same-sex legal union, other than marriage, formed in another jurisdiction that is
substantially equivalent to a State of California-registered domestic partnership; or (iii) filing of a
Declaration of Domestic Partnership form with the University. An Insured student’s opposite-sex
Domestic Partner will be eligible for coverage only if one or both partners are age 62 or older and
eligible for Social Security benefits based on age.
• Child: The Insured student’s child(ren) as follows:
− Biological child under the age of 26.
− Stepchild: A stepchild under the age of 26 is a Dependent as of the date the Insured student
marries the child's parent.
− Adopted child under the age of 26, including a child placed with the Insured student or the
Insured student’s Spouse or Domestic Partner, for the purpose of adoption, from the moment of
placement as certified by the agency making the placement.
− Child of the Insured student’s Domestic Partner: A child of the Insured student’s Domestic
Partner under the age of 26 is a Dependent as of the Effective Date of the domestic partnership.
− Foster Child: A foster child under the age of 18 is a Dependent from the moment of placement
with the Insured student as certified by the agency making the placement. In certain
circumstances, the foster child age limit may be extended in accordance with the provision for
a non-minor Dependent, as defined in the California Welfare and Institutions Code Section
11400(v).
− A child for whom the Insured student is legally required to provide health insurance in
accordance with an administrative or court order, provided that the child otherwise meets UC
SHIP eligibility requirements.
− Dependent Adult Child: A child who is 26 years of age or older and: (i) was covered under the
prior plan, or has six or more months of creditable coverage, (ii) is chiefly dependent on the
student, Spouse or Domestic Partner for support and maintenance, and (iii) is incapable of selfsustaining employment due to a physical or mental condition. A Physician must certify in writing
that the child is incapable of self-sustaining employment due to a physical or mental condition.
The University may request proof of these conditions in order to continue coverage. The
University must receive the certification, at no expense to the University, within 60 days of the
date the student receives the request. The University may request proof of continuing
dependency and that a physical or mental condition still exists, but, not more often than once
each year after the initial certification. This exception will last until the child is no longer chiefly
dependent on the student, Spouse or Domestic Partner for support and maintenance due to a
continuing physical or mental condition. A Dependent adult child is considered chiefly
dependent for support and maintenance if he or she qualifies as a Dependent for federal income
tax purposes.
Note: If both student parents are covered as Insured students, their children may be
covered as the Dependents of either, but not of both.
13

or the Domestic Partner has the legal right to control the child’s health care
• For a child covered under a court order, a copy of the document from the court
• International student dependents must provide a copy of their passport.
3. To obtain coverage for children, the Plan requires you to give AHP a copy of any legal documents
awarding guardianship of such child(ren) to you. This must be provided or translated into English.
Types of Coverage
The types of coverage available to the Insured students and eligible Dependents are indicated at the time
of enrollment through the Plan Administrator.
When You Can Enroll
We do not require written applications from registered students. The University of California will maintain
records of all students registered each academic term and will automatically enroll all registered students for
coverage under this Plan each academic term. Students who provide proof that they have other health
coverage that meets the University’s requirements may apply to waive enrollment in the Plan.
Students who involuntarily lose their other health coverage during the Coverage Period must notify the
student health services on their campus with an official written letter of termination from the previous health
insurance carrier. These students will be enrolled in UC SHIP as of the date of their involuntary loss of other
coverage if they notify the student health services within 31 days of the loss of their coverage. If the student
does not notify the student health services within the 31 days, coverage will be effective on the date the
student pays the full premium. The premium is not pro-rated for enrollment occurring after the start of a
Coverage Period.
Non-registered students and eligible Dependents who enroll on a voluntary basis must submit an
enrollment application for each academic term of coverage. Enrollment applications must be received
within 30 days of the start of the coverage period. The coverage will begin on the first day of that period.
Enrollment will not be continued to the next Coverage Period (academic term) unless a new
application is received. A reminder of re-enrollment will not be provided.
14
To enroll a Dependent, you must contact AHP Customer Care Unit at1-855-427-3209. Your dependents
must meet all Dependent eligibility criteria established by the Plan Administrator, and be one of the
following.
Dependents of covered students may be enrolled, outside of an enrollment period for a particular Coverage
Period, within 31 calendar days of the following events:
1. For Spouse, the date of issuance of the marriage certificate.
2. For a Domestic Partner, the date that the Certificate of Registered Domestic Partnership is filed with the
State of California, other jurisdiction, or the date the completed Declaration of Domestic Partnership form
issued by the University is received by the student health services.
3. For a biological child, the date of birth.
4. For an adopted or foster child, the date of placement with the student or Domestic Partner.
5. For any Dependent, the date of loss of other coverage. An official letter of termination from the insurance
carrier must be provided at the time of enrollment in UC SHIP.
6. For a child covered under a court order, the date that the court orders that the child be covered.
Non-registered students and eligible Dependents enroll by contacting AHP at 1-855-427-3209.
Important Note Regarding Newborn Children. If the student is already covered, any child born to the
student will be covered under the student’s benefits from the moment of birth, provided Anthem Blue Cross
is notified of the birth within 31 days. Coverage will be in effect for 31 days under the covered parent’s plan
without additional cost to the student. If both parents are UC SHIP members, the newborn coverage will be
assigned to the mother for the first 31 days.
For continued newborn coverage beyond the 31 days described in the preceding paragraph, the parent must
enroll the newborn as a Dependent under UC SHIP within 31 days of the date of birth. The student must
contact AHP at 1-855-427-3209to enroll the child as a Dependent.
Special Enrollment Periods
If a student or Dependent does not enroll for coverage when they were first eligible, they may be able to
join the Plan if they qualify for Special Enrollment. The student or Dependent must request Special
Enrollment within 31 days of a qualifying event.
Special Enrollment is available for eligible individuals who:
• Lost eligibility under a prior health plan for reasons other than non-payment of premium or due to
fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact.
• Exhausted COBRA benefits or Plan Administrator contributions toward coverage were terminated.
• Lost employer contributions towards the cost of the other coverage
• Are now eligible for coverage due to marriage, domestic partnership, birth, adoption, or placement
for adoption.
15
Nondiscrimination
No person who is eligible to enroll will be refused enrollment based on health status, health care needs,
genetic information, previous medical information, disability, sexual orientation or identity, gender or age.
Statements and Forms
All Members must complete forms or statements that the Plan may reasonably request.
Any rights to benefits under this Plan are subject to the condition that all such information is true, correct,
and complete. Any material misrepresentation by you may result in termination of coverage as provided in
the “Termination and Continuation of Coverage” section. This does not apply, however, to fraudulent
misstatements.
16
How Your Plan Works
Students of the University of California should seek non-Emergency or non-urgent medical care at
student health services on campus. Student health services is your medical home, and they can
diagnose and treat most illnesses and coordinate all of your healthcare.
Students at UC Merced and covered Dependents may seek medical services off campus from any health
care professional or Facility. A Referral from a Primary Care Physician (PCP) (e.g., a family practice, general
medicine or internal medicine Physician) is required prior to seeking care from a Specialist. The Referral
does not guarantee payment or coverage. With the Referral in hand you choose from Network or Out-ofNetwork Providers. Review the benefits listed in this Benefit Booklet to determine your most cost-effective
option. The services must be Medically Necessary and a covered benefit under this plan.
Note: Student health services on campus does not provide medical, pharmacy, dental and vision services
for covered Dependents.
Prior Referral from a Primary Care Physician is not required for Emergency or urgent care, or services of a
pediatrician, obstetrician, or gynecologist.
Network Services
Your Plan is a PPO plan. The Plan is divided into two sets of benefits: Network and Out-of-Network. If you
choose a Network Provider, you will pay less in out-of-pocket costs, such as Copayments, Deductibles, and
Coinsurance. If you use an Out-of-Network Provider, you will have to pay more in out-of-pocket expenses.
When you use a Network Provider or get care as part of an Authorized Service, Covered Services will be
covered at the Network level. The Claims Administrator has final authority to determine the Medical
Necessity of the service. The University of California five health systems, including hospitals, and
other medical facilities, and affiliated professional providers have agreed to special discounted rates
for UC SHIP members.
Network Providers include various types of "Network Providers" who contract with the Claims Administrator
to care for you. These providers are called "Network Providers" because they have agreed to participate in
the Claims Administrator’s preferred provider organization program (PPO), called the Prudent Buyer Plan.
Network Providers have agreed to rates they will accept as reimbursement for Covered Services. The cost
of benefits provided under this Plan will generally be lower for Network Providers than for Out-of-Network
Providers. The University of California five health systems, including hospitals, and other medical
facilities, and affiliated professional providers have agreed to special discounted rates for UC SHIP
members.
To see a Doctor, call their office:
• Tell them you are an Anthem Member,
• Have your Member Identification Card handy. The Doctor’s office may ask you for your group or Member
ID number.
• Tell them the reason for your visit.
When you go to the office, be sure to bring your Member Identification Card with you. You can provide a
copy from your student health mobile app (mobilehealthconsumer/student from the App Store or Google
Play).
17
For services rendered by Network Providers:
1. You will not be required to file any claims. Network Providers will file claims for Covered Services for
you. (You will still need to pay any Coinsurance, Copayments, and/or Deductibles that apply.) You
may be billed by your Network Provider(s) for any non-Covered Services you get or when you have
not followed with the terms of this Benefit Booklet.
2. Precertification will be done by the Network Provider. (See the “Getting Approval for Benefits” section
for further details.)
Please refer to the “Claims Payment” section for additional information on Authorized Services.
Note: Payment of Emergency room claims is subject to review by the Claims Administrator. The Claims
Administrator makes the final determination regarding whether services were rendered for an Emergency.
Contracting and Non-Contracting Hospitals are another type of service providers. They are different
from a Hospital which is a Network Provider. The Claims Administrator has contracted with most hospitals
in California to obtain certain advantages for patients covered under the Plan. While only some hospitals
are Network Providers, all eligible California hospitals are invited to be Contracting Hospitals and most--
over 90%--accept. For those which do not (called Non-Contracting Hospitals), there is a significant
benefit penalty in your Plan.
Out-of-Network Services and Benefits
Services which are not obtained from a Network Provider or as part of an Authorized Service will be
considered an Out-of-Network service, unless otherwise indicated in this Benefit Booklet.
For services rendered by an Out-of-Network Provider:
1. The Out-of-Network Provider can charge you the difference between their bill and the Plan’s Maximum
Allowed Amount plus any Deductible and/or Coinsurance/Copayments;
2. You may have higher cost sharing amounts (i.e., Deductibles, Coinsurance, and/or Copayments);
3. You will have to pay for services that are not Medically Necessary;
4. You will have to pay non-Covered Services;
5. You may have to file claims; and
6. You must make sure any necessary Precertification is done. (Please see the “Obtaining Approval for
Benefits” section for further details.)
Exceptions to Out-of-Network Services and Benefits:
Your Co-Insurance for Out-of-Network Providers will be the same as for Network Providers for the
following services. You may be responsible for charges which exceed the Maximum Allowed Amount.
a. Emergency services provided by other than a Hospital;
b. The first 48 hours of Emergency services provided by a hospital (the Network Provider Co-Insurance
will continue to apply to an Out-of-Network Provider beyond the first 48 hours if you, in the Claims
Administrator’s judgment, cannot be safely moved);
18
c. The services of an Out-of-Network Provider when Anthem approves a referral from a Physician who is
a Network Provider or from the student health services (see the provision AUTHORIZED SERVICE(S) on
page 99 ;
d. Charges by a type of Physician not represented in the Prudent Buyer Plan network (for example, an
audiologist);
e. Clinical Trials; or
f. The services of an anesthesiologist and assistant surgeon who are Out-of-Network Providers when the
Hospital where the surgery is to be performed, or Ambulatory Surgical Facility, AND the operating
Physician are BOTH Network Providers.
Note: Payment of Emergency room claims is subject to review by the Claims Administrator. The Claims
Administrator makes the final determination regarding whether services were rendered for an Emergency.
How to Find a Provider in the Network
There are three ways you can find out if a Provider or Facility is in the Claims Administrator’s network. You
can also find out where they are located and details about their license or training:
• See your Plan’s directory of Network Providers at www.anthem.com/ca, choose a plan/network - UC
SHIP PPO, which lists the Physicians, Providers, and Facilities that participate in this Plan’s network.
• Call Member Services to request a list of Physicians and Providers that participate in this Plan’s
network, based on specialty and geographic area.
• Check with your Physician or Provider.
Please note that not all Network Providers offer all services. For example, some hospital-based labs are
not part of our Reference Lab Network. In those cases you will have to go to a lab in the Reference Lab
Network to get Network benefits. Please call Member Services before you get services for more
information.
If you need details about a Provider’s license or training, or help choosing a Physician who is right for you,
call the Member Services number on the back of your Member Identification Card (1-866-940-8306).
TTY/TDD services also are available by dialing 711. A special operator will get in touch with the Claims
Administrator to help with your needs.
Please note that Anthem has several networks, please make sure to choose the UC SHIP PPO network
when choosing a provider.
Emergency Services Provided by Out-of-Network Providers. Out-of-Network Providers may send
you a bill and collect for the amount of the Out-of-Network Provider’s charge that exceeds the Maximum
Allowed Amount under this Plan. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum
Allowed Amount and the amount the Out-of-Network Provider charges. This amount can be significant.
If you receive a bill, please contact your campus student health services insurance office at 1-209-228-
2273 for additional information or assistance. Covered Dependents must contact the Claims
Administrator at 1-866-940-8306 for additional information or assistance.
19
Timely Access to Care
Anthem has contracted with health care service providers to provide Covered Services in a manner
appropriate for your condition, consistent with good professional practice. Anthem ensures that its
contracted provider networks have the capacity and availability to offer appointments within the
following timeframes:
• Urgent Care appointments for services that do not require prior authorization: within fortyeight (48) hours of the request for an appointment;
• Urgent Care appointments for services that require prior authorization: within ninety-six (96)
hours of the request for an appointment;
• Non-Urgent appointments for primary care: within ten (10) business days of the request for an
appointment;
• Non-Urgent appointments with specialists: within fifteen (15) business days of the request for
an appointment;
If a Provider determines that the waiting time for an appointment can be extended without a
detrimental impact on your health, the Provider may schedule an appointment for a later time
than noted above.
Anthem arranges for telephone triage or screening services for you twenty-four (24) hours per day,
seven (7) days per week with a waiting time of no more than thirty (30) minutes. If Anthem contracts
with a Provider for telephone triage or screening services, the Provider will utilize a telephone
answering machine and/or an answering service and/or office staff, during and after business hours, to
inform you of the wait time for a return call from the Provider or how the Member may obtain urgent
care or Emergency services or how to contact another Provider who is on-call for telephone triage or
screening services.
If you need the services of an interpreter, the services will be coordinated with scheduled
appointments and will not result in a delay of an appointment with a Network Provider.
The BlueCard Program
Like all Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans throughout the country, the Claims Administrator participates in a
program called "BlueCard," which provides services to you when you are outside the Service Area. For
more details on this program, please see “Inter-Plan Arrangements” in the “Claims Payment” section.
20
Identification Card
A health app is available that allows UC SHIP Members and their Dependents to access Plan Identification
Cards and benefits information from their mobile devices. To learn more about these services, please call
UC SHIP Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 or download the app from the App Store or Google play
(mobilehealthconsumer/student) to download the StudentHealth app. Once you have the app, follow these
three steps to register:
1. Enter you first name, last name, student ID number and date of birth (mm/dd/yyyy); then go to the
next screen.
2. On the next screen, called Credentials, notice your assigned user name. For most students, your
username is, "firstname.lastname" but if another student in the UC system has the same name,
you will be assigned a user name with the number "1," "2" or so on after it.
3. Create a password containing at least six characters, including a letter and number.
The Claims Administrator will provide an electronic Identification Card to each Member enrolled in the
Plan. When you get care, you must show your Identification Card. Only covered Members have the right
to receive services under this Plan. If anyone gets services or benefits to which they are not entitled to
under the terms of this Benefit Booklet, he/she must pay for the actual cost of the services.
You may not knowingly permit the use of your Plan Identification Card by someone other than yourself or
your dependents to obtain services.
21
Schedule of Benefits
In this section you will find an outline of the benefits included in your Plan and a summary of any Deductibles,
Coinsurance, and Copayments that you must pay. Also listed are any Benefit Year Maximums or limits that
apply. Please read the "What’s Covered" for more details on the Plan’s Covered Services. Read the “What’s
Not Covered” section for details on Excluded Services.
All Covered Services are subject to the conditions, exclusions, limitations, and terms of this Benefit Booklet
including any endorsements, amendments, or riders.
To get the highest benefits at the lowest out-of-pocket cost, you must get Covered Services from a
Network Provider. Benefits for Covered Services are based on the Maximum Allowed Amount, which is
the most the Plan will allow for a Covered Service. When you use an Out-of-Network Provider you may
have to pay the difference between the Out-of-Network Provider’s billed charge and the Maximum Allowed
Amount in addition to any Coinsurance, Copayments, Deductibles, and non-covered charges. This amount
can be substantial. Please read the “Claims Payment” section for more details.
Certain services require prior authorization in order for benefits to be provided. Network Providers will initiate
the review on your behalf. An Out-of-Network Provider may or may not initiate the review for you. In both
cases, it is your responsibility to initiate the process and ask your Physician to request prior authorization.
You may also call Anthem directly. Please see “Getting Approval for Benefits” for more details.
Deductibles, Coinsurance, and Benefit Year Maximums are calculated based upon the Maximum Allowed
Amount, not the Provider’s billed charges.
Essential Health Benefits provided within this Benefit Booklet are not subject to lifetime or annual
dollar maximums. Certain non-essential health benefits, however, are subject to either a lifetime
and/or dollar maximum.
Essential Health Benefits are defined by federal law and refer to benefits in at least the following
categories:
• Ambulatory patient services,
• Emergency services,
• Hospitalization,
• Maternity and newborn care,
• Mental Health and Substance Abuse disorder services, including behavioral health treatment,
• Prescription drugs,
• Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices,
• Laboratory services,
• Preventive and wellness services, and
• Chronic disease management and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.
Such benefits shall be consistent with those set forth under the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act of 2010 and any regulations issued pursuant thereto.
22
Deductible – Plan Year Network Out-of-Network
Per Member $200
Per Family – All other Members combined $400
All medical services and supplies received outside the student health services that are covered under this Plan
are subject to the Benefit Year Deductible, unless otherwise indicated.
When the Deductible applies, you must pay it before benefits begin. See the sections below to find out when
the Deductible applies.
The Network and Out-of-Network Deductibles are combined.
The Deductible does not include penalties for not getting required Precertification.
The Benefit Year Deductible will not apply to benefits for prescription drugs under your OptumRx Prescription
Drug Plan. For additional information contact OptumRx at 1-844-265-1879 or www.optumrx.com.
Pediatric Vision Services are not subject to the Deductible.
There is a separate Pediatric Dental Deductible. Please see “Pediatric Dental Services” for details.
Coinsurance Network Out-of-Network
Plan Pays 90% 60%
Member Pays 10% 40%
Reminder: Your Coinsurance will be based on the Maximum Allowed Amount, not the Provider’s billed charges.
If you use an Out-of-Network Provider, you may have to pay Coinsurance plus the difference between the Outof-Network Provider’s billed charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount.
Note: The Coinsurance listed above may not apply to all benefits, and some benefits may have a different
Coinsurance. For example, the coinsurance for ambulance services and psycho-educational testing are based
upon billed charges. Please see the rest of this Schedule for details.
23
Out-of-Pocket Limit Network Out-of-Network
Per Member $3,000 $6,000
Per Family – All other Members combined $6,000 $12,000
The Out-of-Pocket Limit includes all covered medical, prescription drug and pediatric dental Deductibles,
Coinsurance, and Copayments you pay during a Benefit Year unless otherwise indicated below. It does not
include charges over the Maximum Allowed Amount or amounts you pay for non-Covered Services. It does not
include penalties for not getting required Precertification.
Once the Out-of- Pocket Limit is satisfied, you will not have to pay any additional Deductibles, Coinsurance, or
Copayments for the rest of the Benefit Year.
The Network and Out-of-Network Out-of-Pocket Limits are separate and do not apply toward each other.
Note: Any Copayments or Coinsurance you pay toward your prescription drug benefit will apply towards your
Medical and Prescription Drug Out-of-Pocket Limit. For additional information contact OptumRx at 1-844-265-
1879 or www.optumrx.com.
Important Notice about Your Cost Shares
For certain Covered Services, and depending on your Plan design, you may be required to pay all or a part
of the Maximum Allowed Amount as your cost share amount (Deductibles, Coinsurance or Copayments).
Your cost share amount may be different depending on whether you received Covered Services from a
Network Provider or Out-of-Network Provider. Specifically, you may be required to pay higher cost-share
amounts or may have limits on your benefits when using Out-of-Network Providers. Please see the
“Schedule of Benefits” section for your cost share responsibilities and limitations, or call the Member Services
telephone number (1-866-940-8306) on your Identification Card to learn how this Plan’s benefits or cost
share amount may vary by the type of Provider you use.
The Claims Administrator will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You may be
responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether
such services are performed by a Network Provider or Out-of-Network Provider. Non-Covered Services
include services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of your Plan and services received after
benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, Medical Benefit
Maximums or day/visit limits.
In some instances you may only be asked to pay the lower Network Provider cost share percentage when
you use an Out-of-Network Provider. For example, if you go to a Network Hospital or Facility and receive
Covered Services from an Out-of-Network Provider such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist
providing services at the Hospital or Facility, you will pay the Network Provider cost share percentage of the
Maximum Allowed Amount for those Covered Services. However, you also may be liable for the difference
between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out-of-Network Provider’s charge, called “Balance Billing.”
(Please see above exceptions for Out-of-Network Services and Benefits.)
24
The tables below outline the Plan’s Covered Services and the cost share(s) you must pay. In many spots
you will see the statement, “Benefits are based on the setting in which Covered Services are received.” In
these cases you should determine where you will receive the service (i.e., in a Doctor’s office, at an
outpatient Hospital Facility, etc.) and look up that location to find out which cost share will apply. For
example, you might get physical therapy in a Doctor’s office, an outpatient Hospital Facility, or during an
Inpatient Hospital stay. For services in the office, look up “Office Visits.” For services in the outpatient
department of a hospital, look up “Outpatient Facility Services.” For services during an Inpatient stay, look
up “Inpatient Services.”
Emergency Services Provided by Out-of-Network Providers. Out-of-Network Providers may send
you a bill and collect for the amount of the Out-of-Network Provider’s charge that exceeds the Maximum
Allowed Amount under this Plan. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum
Allowed Amount and the amount the Out-of-Network Provider charges. This amount can be significant.
If you receive a bill, please contact your campus student health center insurance office at 1-209-228-
2273 for additional information or assistance. Covered Dependents must contact the Claims
Administrator at 1-866-940-8306, as listed on their Identification Card, for additional information or
assistance.
Reduction of The Maximum Allowed Amount for Non-Contracting Hospitals. A small percentage
of hospitals which are Out-of-Network Providers are also Non-Contracting Hospitals. Except for
Emergency care, the Maximum Allowed Amount is reduced by 25% for all services and supplies
provided by a Non-Contracting Hospital. You will be responsible for paying this amount. You are strongly
encouraged to avoid this additional expense by seeking care from a Contracting Hospital. You can call
Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 to locate a Contracting Hospital.

Human Organ and Tissue Transplant (Bone Marrow / Stem Cell) Services
Please call the Transplant Department at 1-800-824-0581 as soon as you think you may need a transplant
to talk about your benefit options. You must do this before you have an evaluation and/or work-up for a
transplant. To get the most benefits under your Plan, you must get certain human organ and tissue
transplant services from the Centers of Medical Excellence (CME), Blue Distinction Centers for Specialty
Care (BDCSC) or a UC Family Provider.
The Claims Administrator provides access to Centers of Medical Excellence (CME) networks and Blue
Distinction Centers for Specialty Care (BDCSC). Even if a Hospital is a Network Provider for other services, it
may not be a Network Transplant Provider for certain transplant services. These procedures are covered
only when performed at a CME, BDCSC or by a UC Family Provider.
Please call to find out which Hospitals are Network Transplant Providers. (When calling Member Services, ask
for the Transplant Case Manager for further details.)
The facilities included in each of these networks are selected to provide the following specified medical
services:
• Transplant facilities have been organized to provide services for the following specified transplants: heart,
liver, lung, combination heart-lung, kidney, pancreas, simultaneous pancreas-kidney, or bone marrow/stem
cell and similar procedures. Subject to any applicable co-payments or deductibles, CME and BDCSC have
agreed to a rate they will accept as payment in full for Covered Services. These procedures are covered
only when performed at a CME, BDCSC or by a UC Family provider.
The requirements described below do not apply to the following:
• Cornea transplants, which are covered as any other surgery; and
• Any Covered Services related to a Covered Transplant Procedure that you get before or after the Transplant
Benefit Period. Please note that the initial evaluation, any added tests to determine your eligibility as a
candidate for a transplant by your Provider, and the collection and storage of bone marrow/stem cells is
included in the Covered Transplant Procedure benefit regardless of the date of service.
Benefits for Covered Services that are not part of the Human Organ and Tissue Transplant benefit will be based
on the setting in which Covered Services are received. Please see the “What’s Covered” section for additional
details.

Getting Approval for Benefits
Your Plan includes the process of Utilization Review to decide when services are Medically Necessary or
Experimental/Investigational as those terms are defined in this Benefit Booklet. Utilization Review aids the
delivery of cost-effective health care by reviewing the use of treatments and, when proper, level of care
and/or the setting or place of service that they are performed.
Reviewing Where Services Are Provided
A service must be Medically Necessary to be a Covered Service. When level of care, setting or place of
service is part of the review, services that can be safely given to you in a lower level of care or lower cost
setting / place of care, will not be Medically Necessary if they are given in a higher level of care, or higher
cost setting / place of care. This means that a request for a service may be denied because it is not
Medically Necessary for the service to be provided where it is being requested. When this happens the
service can be requested again in another place and will be reviewed again for Medical Necessity. At times
a different provider or facility my need to be used in order for the service to be considered Medically
Necessary. Examples include, but are not limited to:
• A service may be denied on an inpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable if provided on an
outpatient basis at a Hospital.
• A service may be denied on an outpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable at a free
standing imaging center, infusion center, Ambulatory Surgical Facility, or in a Physician’s office.
• A service may be denied at a Skilled Nursing Facility but may be approvable in a home setting.
Utilization Review criteria will be based on many sources including medical policy and clinical guidelines.
Anthem may decide that a treatment that was asked for is not Medically Necessary if a clinically equivalent
treatment that is more cost effective is available and appropriate. “Clinically equivalent” means treatments
that for most Members, will give you similar results for a disease or condition.
If you have any questions about the information in this section, you may call the UC SHIP Member Services
at 1-866-940-8306.
Coverage for or payment of the service or treatment reviewed is not guaranteed even if it's decided
your services are Medically Necessary. For benefits to be covered, on the date you get service:
1. You must be eligible for benefits;
2. Premium must be paid for the time period that services are given;
3. The service or supply must be a Covered Service under your Plan;
4. The service cannot be subject to an Exclusion under your Plan; and
5. You must not have exceeded any applicable limits under your Plan.
Types of Reviews
• Pre-service Review – A review of a service, treatment or admission for a coverage determination
which is done before the service or treatment begins or admission date.
− Precertification – A required Pre-service Review, for a benefit coverage determination for a
service or treatment. Certain services require Precertification in order for you to get benefits. The
benefit coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of
Medical Necessity or is Experimental / Investigational as those terms are defined in this Benefit
Booklet.
For admission following Emergency Care, you, your authorized representative or Doctor must notify
the Claims Administrator within 72 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a
reasonable period of time. For labor/ childbirth admissions, Precertification is not needed unless
49
there is a problem and/or the mother and baby are not sent home at the same time. Precertification
is not required for the first 48 hours for a vaginal delivery or 96 hours for a cesarean section.
Admissions longer than 48/96 hours require precertification.
− Predetermination – An optional, voluntary Review request for a benefit coverage determination
for a service or treatment if there is a related clinical coverage guideline. The benefit coverage
review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical Necessity
or is Experimental / Investigational as those terms are defined in this Benefit Booklet.
• Continued Stay / Concurrent Review – A Utilization Review of a service, treatment or admission for
a benefit coverage determination which must be done during an ongoing stay in a Facility or course of
treatment.
Both Pre-service and Continued Stay / Concurrent Reviews may be considered urgent when, in the view
of the treating Provider or any Doctor with knowledge of your medical condition, without such care or
treatment, your life or health or your ability to regain maximum function could be seriously threatened or
you could be subjected to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without such care or treatment.
Urgent reviews are conducted under a shorter timeframe than standard reviews.
• Post-service Review – A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage that is
conducted after the service has been provided. Post-service Reviews are performed when a service,
treatment or admission did not need a Precertification, or when a needed Precertification was not
obtained or a Predetermination review was not performed. Post-service Reviews are done for a
service, treatment or admission in which the Claims Administrator has a related clinical coverage
guideline and are typically initiated by the Claims Administrator.
Services for which Precertification is required (i.e., services that need to be reviewed by the Claims
Administrator to determine whether they are Medically Necessary) include, but are not limited to, the
following:
1. Admissions to a Skilled Nursing Facility if you require daily skilled nursing or rehabilitation, as certified
by your attending Physician.
2. Air ambulance services for non-Emergency Hospital to Hospital transfers.
3. Certain non-Emergency ground ambulance services
4. Bariatric surgical services, such as gastric bypass and other surgical procedures for weight loss,
including bariatric travel expense if:
a. The services are to be performed for the treatment of morbid obesity;
b. The physicians on the surgical team and the facility in which the surgical procedure is to take place
are approved for the surgical procedure requested; and
c. The bariatric surgical procedure will be performed at a BDCSC facility or by a UC Family provider.
5. Behavioral health treatment for Pervasive Developmental Disorder or Autism.
6. Fertility Preservation and related Covered Services.
7. Home health care. The following criteria must be met:
a. The services can be safely provided in your home, as certified by your attending Physician;
b. Your attending Physician manages and directs your medical care at home; and
c. Your attending Physician has established a definitive treatment plan which must be consistent with
your medical needs and lists the services to be provided by the Home Health Care Agency.
8. Scheduled, non-emergency inpatient Hospital stays and Residential Treatment Center admissions.
50
Exceptions: Utilization review is not required for Inpatient Hospital stays for the following services:
a. Maternity care of 48 hours or less following a normal delivery or 96 hours or less following a
cesarean section; and
9. Mastectomy in association with a breast cancer diagnosis and lymph node dissection. Services of a
home infusion therapy provider if the attending Physician has submitted both a prescription
and a plan of treatment before services are rendered.
10. Transgender surgery benefits and related Covered Services will be provided as follows:
a. The Surgical Procedure:
− The services are Medically Necessary and appropriate; and
− The physicians on the surgical team and the facility in which the surgery is to take place are
approved for the transgender surgery requested.
b. Transgender Surgery Travel Expense:
− It is for transgender surgery and related services, authorized by the Claims Administrator; and
− The transgender surgery must be performed at a specific facility designated by the Claims
Administrator which is approved for the transgender surgery requested.
11. Transplant services including transplant travel expense. The following criteria must be met for certain
transplants, as follows:
a. For bone, skin or cornea transplants, if the physicians on the surgical team and the facility in which
the transplant is to take place are approved for the transplant requested.
b. For transplantation of heart, liver, lung, combination heart-lung, kidney, pancreas, simultaneous
pancreas-kidney or bone marrow/stem cell and similar procedures, if the providers of the related
preoperative and postoperative services are approved and the transplant will be performed at a
Centers of Medical Excellence (CME), Blue Distinction Centers for Specialty Care (BDCSC) facility.
Who is Responsible for Precertification?
Typically, Network Providers know which services need Precertification and will get any Precertification
when needed, or ask for a Predetermination, even though it is not required. Your Primary Care Physician
and other Network Providers have been given detailed information about these procedures and they are
responsible for meeting these requirements. If services are requested at an out-of-network, nonparticipating provider, or Blue Card provider, you are responsible to obtain the Precertification. When you
are travelling abroad and need medical care, you can call Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service
Center any time. They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Claims Administrator to ask for a Precertification or Predetermination review. However, you may request
a Precertification or Predetermination or you may choose an authorized representative to act on your
behalf for a specific request. The authorized representative can be anyone who is 18 years of age or

How Decisions Regarding Medical Necessity are Made
The Claims Administrator will use clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy, clinical guidelines,
and other applicable policies to help make Medical Necessity decisions. Medical policies and clinical
guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions identified as proper medical practice.
The Claims Administrator reserves the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines from
time to time.
You are entitled to ask for and get, free of charge, reasonable access to any records concerning your
request. To ask for this information, call the Precertification phone number at 1-800-274-7767, which also
appears on the back of your Identification Card.
If you are not satisfied with the Claims Administrator's decision under this section of your benefits, please
refer to the "Your Right to Appeals" section to see what rights may be available to you.
Decision and Notification Requirements
The Claims Administrator will review requests for benefits according to the timeframes listed below. The
timeframes and requirements listed are based on federal regulations. You may call 1-866-940-8306 for
52
additional information.
Type of Review Timeframe Requirement for Decision and
Notification
Urgent Pre-service Review 72 hours from the receipt of request
Non-Urgent Pre-service Review 15 calendar days from the receipt of the request

If more information is needed to make their decision, the Claims Administrator will tell the requesting
Provider of the specific information needed to finish the review. If Claims Administrator does not get the
specific information needed by the required timeframe, a decision will be made based upon the
information received.
The Claims Administrator will give notice to you and your Provider of its decision as required by state and
federal regulations. Notice may be given by one or more of the following methods: verbal, written, and/or
electronic.
Important Information
The Claims Administrator may, from time to time, waive, enhance, change or end certain medical
management processes (including utilization management, case management, and disease management)
and/or offer an alternate benefit if in its sole discretion, such change furthers the provision of cost effective,
value based and/or quality services.
The Claims Administrator may also select certain qualifying Providers to take part in a program or a provider
arrangement that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would
otherwise apply. The Claims Administrator may also exempt your claim from medical review if certain
conditions apply.
Just because the Claims Administrator exempts a process, Provider or Claim from the standards which
otherwise would apply, it does not mean that the Claims Administrator will do so in the future, or will do so
in the future for any other Provider, claim or Member. The Claims Administrator may stop or change any
such exemption with or without advance notice. You may find out whether a Provider is taking part in certain
programs by contacting the Member Services number at 1-866-940-8306, which is indicated on the back of
your Identification Card.
The Claims Administrator also may identify certain Providers to review for potential fraud, waste, abuse or
other inappropriate activity if the claims data suggests there may be inappropriate billing practices. If a
Provider is selected under this program, then the Claims Administrator may use one or more clinical
utilization management guidelines in the review of claims submitted by this Provider, even if those
guidelines are not used for all Providers delivering services to this Plan’s Members.
Health Plan Individual Case Management
53
Our health plan individual case management programs (Case Management) helps coordinate services for
Members with health-care needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic health conditions. The Claims
Administrator’s programs coordinate benefits and educate Members who agree to take part in the Case
Management Program to help meet their health-related needs.
Case Management programs are confidential and voluntary and are made available at no extra cost to
you. These programs are provided by, or on behalf of and at the request of, your health plan case
management staff. These Case Management programs are separate from any Covered Services you are
receiving.
If you meet program criteria and agree to take part in, the Claims Administrator will help you meet your
identified health care needs. This is reached through contact and team work with you and/or your chosen
authorized representative, treating Physician(s), and other Providers.
In addition, the Claims Administrator may assist with coordinating care with existing community-based
programs and services to meet your needs. This may include giving you information about external
agencies and community-based programs and services.
In certain cases of severe or chronic illness or injury, the Plan may provide benefits for alternate care that
is not listed as a Covered Service. The Plan may also extend Covered Services beyond the Benefit Year
Maximums of this Plan. The Claims Administrator will make its decision case-by-case, if in the Claims
Administrator’s discretion the alternate or extended benefit is in the best interest of you and the Plan, and
you or your authorized representative agree to the alternate or extended benefit in writing. A decision to
provide extended benefits or approve alternate care in one case does not obligate the Plan to provide the
same benefits again to you or to any other Member. The Plan reserves the right, at any time, to alter or
stop providing extended benefits or approving alternate care. In such case, the Claims Administrator will
notify you or your authorized representative in writing.
54
What’s Covered
This section describes the Covered Services available under your Plan. Your Covered Services are subject
to all the terms and conditions listed in this Benefit Booklet, including, but not limited to, Benefit Maximums,
Deductibles, Copayments, Coinsurance, exclusions and Medical Necessity requirements. Please refer to
the "Schedule of Benefits" for details on the amounts you are required to pay for Covered Services and for
details on any Benefit Maximums. Also be sure to refer to the "How Your Plan Works" section for additional
information on your Plan’s rules. Read the “What’s Not Covered” section for important details on Excluded
Services.
Your benefits are described below. Benefits are listed alphabetically to make them easy to find. Please
note that several sections may apply to your claims. For example, if you have a surgery, benefits for your
Hospital stay will be described under "Hospital Services" and benefits for your Physician’s services will be
described under "Physician’s Services." As a result, you should review all benefit descriptions that might
apply to your claims.
You should also be aware that many of the Covered Services can be received in several settings, including
a Physician’s office, an Urgent Care Facility, an Outpatient Facility, or an Inpatient Facility. Benefits will
often vary depending on where you choose to receive Covered Services, and this can result in a change in
the amount you will need to pay. Please see the “Schedule of Benefits” for additional information on how
benefits vary in each setting.
Acupuncture
Please see “Therapy Services” later in this section.
Allergy Services
Your Plan includes benefits for Medically Necessary allergy testing and treatment, including allergy serum
and allergy shots.
Ambulance Services
Medically Necessary ambulance services are a Covered Service when one or more of the following are
met:
• You are transported by a state licensed vehicle that is designed, equipped, and used only to transport
the sick and injured and staffed by Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), paramedics, or other
certified medical professionals. This includes ground, water, fixed wing, and rotary wing air
transportation.
• For ground ambulance, you are taken:
− From your home, scene of accident or medical Emergency to a Hospital;
- Between Hospitals, including when the Claims Administrator requires you to move from an Outof-Network Hospital to a Network Hospital;
- Between a Hospital and Skilled Nursing Facility; or
- Between a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility or other approved Facility.
• For air or water ambulance, you are taken:
- From the scene of an accident or medical Emergency to a Hospital;
- Between Hospitals, including when the Claims Administrator requires you to move from an Outof-Network Hospital to a Network Hospital; or
- Between a Hospital and an approved Facility.
55
Ambulance services are subject to Medical Necessity reviews. Emergency ground ambulance services do
not require precertification and are allowed regardless of whether the Provider is a Network or Out-ofNetwork Provider.
Non-Emergency ambulance services are subject to Medical Necessity reviews. When using an air
ambulance for non-Emergency transportation, the Claims Administrator reserves the right to select the air
ambulance Provider. If you do not use the air ambulance Provider selected, the Out-of-Network Provider
may bill you for any charges that exceed the Maximum Allowed Amount. Please see the “Schedule of
Benefits” for the maximum benefit.
You must be taken to the nearest Facility that can give care for your condition. In certain circumstances the
Claims Administrator may approve benefits for transportation to a Facility that is not the nearest Facility.
Benefits also include Medically Necessary treatment of a sickness or injury by medical professionals from
an ambulance service, even if you are not taken to a Facility.
Ambulance services are not covered when another type of transportation can be used without endangering
your health. Ambulance services for your convenience or the convenience of your family or Doctor are not
a Covered Service.
Other non-covered ambulance services include, but are not limited to, trips to:
a) A Doctor’s office or clinic;
b) A morgue or funeral home.
Important Notes on Air Ambulance Benefits
Benefits are only available for air ambulance when it is not appropriate to use a ground or water ambulance.
For example, if using a ground ambulance would endanger your health and your medical condition requires
a more rapid transport to a Facility than the ground ambulance can provide, the Plan will cover the air
ambulance. Air ambulance will also be covered if you are in an area that a ground or water ambulance
cannot reach.
 Air ambulance will not be covered if you are taken to a hospital that is not an acute care hospital (such as
 a skilled nursing facility or a rehabilitation facility), or if you are taken to a physician’s office or to your
 home.
Hospital to Hospital Transport
If you are moving from one Hospital to another, air ambulance will only be covered if using a ground
ambulance would endanger your health and if the Hospital that first treats cannot give you the medical
services you need. Certain specialized services are not available at all Hospitals. For example, burn care,
cardiac care, trauma care, and critical care are only available at certain Hospitals. To be covered, you must
be taken to the closest Hospital that can treat you. Coverage is not available for air ambulance transfers
simply because you, your family, or your Provider prefers a specific Hospital or Physician.
Nonemergency: UC SHIP covers nonemergency ambulance and psychiatric transport van services if a
Physician determines that your condition requires the use of services that only a licensed ambulance (or
psychiatric transport van) can provide and that the use of other means of transportation would endanger
the your health. These services are covered only when the vehicle transports you to and from covered
services.
Ambulance Services exclusion: Transportation by car, taxi, bus, gurney van, and any other type of
transportation (other than a licensed ambulance or psychiatric transport van), even if it is the only way to
travel to a covered service.

orthodontic treatment to make sure it is covered under this Plan.
Medically Necessary Orthodontic Care
Medically Necessary services will be subject to review. To be considered Medically Necessary, the
service must meet criteria for Medically Necessary care as established by the Claims Administrator. The
Plan will cover orthodontic care when it is Medically Necessary to prevent disease and promote oral
health, restore oral structures to health and function, and treat Emergency and urgent conditions.
Your dental provider should submit a prior authorization form to Anthem for this service. This form is
available by calling the telephone number listed on your Identification Card or online at
www.anthem.com/ca. You may call Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 to ask that a prior authorization

• If the Anthem defined criteria is NOT met, the Dental Professional Review area will communicate to
the dentist and Insured about the denial.
• The letters of response contain steps for additional review, including information about filing a
grievance.
• If prior authorization is denied you have the right to file a grievance.
The following conditions automatically qualify for Medically Necessary orthodontic care.
• Cleft palate deformity. If the cleft palate is not visible on the diagnostic casts written documentation
from a credentialed Specialist must be submitted, on his or her professional letterhead, with the prior
authorization request.
• Craniofacial anomaly. Written documentation from a credentialed Specialist shall be submitted, on
his or her professional letterhead, with the prior authorization request.

• Retreatment and services given due to a relapse
• Inpatient or Outpatient Hospital expenses, unless covered by the medical benefits of this Plan

Orthodontic Payments
Because orthodontic treatment normally occurs over a long period of time, payments are made over the
course of your treatment. The covered individual must have continuous coverage under this Plan in order
to receive ongoing payments for your orthodontic treatment.
Payments for treatment are made: 1. when treatment begins (appliances are installed), and 2. at six (6)
month intervals thereafter, until treatment is completed or this coverage ends.
Before treatment begins, the treating dentist should submit a pre-treatment estimate to us. An Estimate
of Benefits form will be sent to you and your dentist indicating the estimated Maximum Allowed Amount,
including any amount (Coinsurance) you may owe. This form serves as a claim form when treatment
begins.
When treatment begins, the dentist should submit the Estimate of Benefit form with the date of appliance
placement and his/her signature. After benefit and eligibility verification by us, a payment will be issued.
A new/revised Estimate of Benefits form will also be issued to you and your dentist. This again will serve
as the claim form to be submitted six (6) months from the date of appliance placement.
Timely Access to Dental Care
Anthem has contracted with dental Providers to provide covered services in a manner appropriate for
Your condition, consistent with good professional practice. Anthem ensures that its network of contracted

later time than noted above.
In Network dental Providers are required to have an answering service or a telephone answering machine
during non-business hours, which will provide instructions on how You can obtain urgent or Emergency
Care including, when applicable, how to contact another dentist who has agreed to be on-call to triage or

Emergency (Emergency Medical Condition)
“Emergency,” or “Emergency Medical Condition” means a medical or behavioral health condition of recent
onset and sufficient severity, including but not limited to, severe pain, that would lead a prudent layperson,
possessing an average knowledge of medicine and health, to believe that his or her condition, sickness, or
injury is of such a nature that failure to obtain immediate medical care could result in: (a) placing the patient’s
health or the health of another person in serious jeopardy or, for a pregnant women, placing the women’s
health or the health of her unborn child in serious jeopardy; (b) serious impairment to bodily functions; or
(c) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. Such conditions include but are not limited to, chest
pain, stroke, poisoning, serious breathing problems, unconsciousness, severe burns or cuts, uncontrolled
bleeding, or seizures and such other acute conditions as may be determined to be Emergencies by the
Claims Administrator.
Emergency Care
“Emergency Care” means a medical or behavioral health exam done in the Emergency Department of a
Hospital and includes services routinely available in the Emergency Department to evaluate an Emergency
Condition. It includes any further medical or behavioral health exams and treatment required to stabilize
the patient.
Medically Necessary services will be covered whether you get care from a Network or Out-of-Network
Provider. Emergency Care you get from an Out-of-Network Provider will be covered, but you may have to
pay the difference between the Out-of-Network Provider’s charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount, as
well as any applicable Coinsurance, Copayment or Deductible.
The Maximum Allowed Amount for Emergency Care from an Out-of-Network Provider will be:
1. The amount negotiated with Network Providers for the Emergency service furnished;
2. The amount for the Emergency service calculated using the same method the Claims Administrator
generally uses to determine payments for Out-of-Network services but substituting the Network costsharing provisions for the Out-of-Network cost-sharing provisions; or
3. The amount that would be paid under Medicare for the Emergency service.
If you are admitted to the Hospital from the Emergency Room, be sure that you or your Doctor calls the
Claims Administrator as soon as possible. The Claims Administrator will review your care to decide if a
Hospital stay is authorized and how many days they will approve. See “Getting Approval for Benefits” for
more details. If you or your Doctor fails to call the Claims Administrator, you may have to pay for services
that are determined to be not Medically Necessary.
67
Treatment you get after your condition has stabilized will be covered as Medically Necessary according to
your attending Physician.
Genetic Testing
Genetic testing for individuals to assess their risk for a variety of conditions.
Note: Testing is only available according to the Claims Administrator’s clinical guidelines. If you have any
questions about the information in this section, please refer to the Claims Administrator’s website at

including necessary acquisition procedures, mobilization, collection and storage. It also includes Medically
Necessary myeloablative or reduced intensity preparative chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a
combination of these therapies.
69
Network Transplant Provider
A Provider that the Claims Administrator has chosen as a Center of Excellence and/or a Provider selected
to take part as a Network Transplant Provider by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The Provider
has entered into a Transplant Provider Agreement to give Covered Transplant Procedures to you and take
care of certain administrative duties for the transplant network. A Provider may be a Network Transplant
Provider for:
• Certain Covered Transplant Procedures; or
• All Covered Transplant Procedures.
Out-of-Network Transplant Provider
Any Provider that has NOT been chosen as a Center of Excellence by the Claims Administrator or has not
been selected to take part as a Network Transplant Provider by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
Transplant Benefit Period
At a Network Transplant Provider Facility, the Transplant Benefit Period starts one day before a Covered
Transplant Procedure and lasts for the applicable case rate / global time period. The number of days will
vary depending on the type of transplant received and the Network Transplant Provider agreement. Call
the Case Manager at 1-800-824-0581 for specific Network Transplant Provider details for services received
at or coordinated by a Network Transplant Provider Facility.
At an Out-of-Network Transplant Provider Facility, the Transplant Benefit Period starts one day before a
Covered Transplant Procedure and lasts until the date of discharge.
Specified Transplants
You must obtain the Claims Administrator’s prior authorization for all services including, but not limited to,
preoperative tests and postoperative care related to the following specified transplants: heart, liver, lung,
combination heart-lung, kidney, pancreas, simultaneous pancreas-kidney, or bone marrow/stem cell and
similar procedures. Specified transplants must be performed at Centers of Medical Excellence (CME) or
Blue Distinction Centers for Specialty Care (BDCSC) or UC Family Provider. Charges for services
provided for or in connection with a specified transplant performed at a facility other than a CME,
BDCSC or a UC Family Provider will not be considered covered. Call the toll-free telephone number
for pre-service review on your ID card if your Physician recommends a specified transplant for your medical
care. A case manager transplant coordinator will assist in facilitating your access to a CME, BDCSC or UC
Family Provider. See “Getting Approval for Benefits” for details.
Prior Approval and Precertification
To maximize your benefits, you should call the Claims Administrator’s Transplant Department as
soon as you think you may need a transplant to talk about your benefit options. You must do this
before you have an evaluation and/or work-up for a transplant. They will help you maximize your
benefits by giving you coverage information, including details on what is covered and if any clinical coverage
guidelines, medical policies, Network Transplant Provider rules, or exclusions apply.
Call Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 and ask for the transplant coordinator. Even if you are given a
prior approval for the Covered Transplant Procedure, you or your Provider must call the Transplant
Department for Precertification prior to the transplant whether this is performed in an Inpatient or
Outpatient setting.
Precertification is required before the Plan will cover benefits for a transplant. Your Physician must certify,
and the Claims Administrator must agree, that the transplant is Medically Necessary. Your Physician
should send a written request for Precertification to the Claims Administrator as soon as possible to start
this process. Not getting Precertification will result in a denial of benefits.
70
Note that there are cases where your Provider asks for approval for Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)
testing, donor searches and/or a collection and storage of stem cells prior to the final decision as to what
transplant procedure will be needed. In these cases, the HLA testing and donor search charges will be
covered as routine diagnostic tests. The collection and storage request will be reviewed for Medical
Necessity and may be approved. However, such an approval for HLA testing, donor search and/or
collection and storage is NOT an approval for the later transplant. A separate Medical Necessity decision
will be needed for the transplant.
Donor Benefits
Benefits for an organ donor are as follows:
• When both the person donating the organ and the person getting the organ are covered Members
under this Plan, each will get benefits under their plan.
• When the person getting the organ is a covered Member under this Plan, but the person donating the
organ is not, benefits under this Plan are limited to benefits not available to the donor from any other

any Hospital length for childbirth for the mother or newborn to less than forty-eight (48) hours following
vaginal birth, or less than ninety-six (96) hours following a cesarean section (C-section). However, federal
law as a rule does not stop the mother’s or newborn’s attending Provider, after consulting with the mother,
from discharging the mother or her newborn earlier than forty-eight (48) hours, or ninety-six (96) hours, as
applicable. In any case, as provided by federal law, the Plan may not require a Provider get authorization

Claims Payment
This section describes how the Claims Administrator reimburses claims and what information is needed
when you submit a claim. When you receive care from a Network Provider, you do not need to file a claim
because the Network Provider will do this for you. If you receive care from an Out-of-Network Provider,
you will need to make sure a claim is filed. Many Out-of-Network Hospitals, Physicians and other Providers
will still submit your claim for you, although they are not required to do so. If you submit the claim, use a
claim form as described later in this section.
Maximum Allowed Amount
GENERAL
This section describes how the Claims Administrator determines the amount of reimbursement for Covered
Services. Reimbursement for services rendered by Network and Out-of-Network Providers is based on this
Plan’s Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that you receive. Please see "Inter-Plan
Arrangements" section for additional information.
The Maximum Allowed Amount is the maximum amount of reimbursement this Plan will allow for services
and supplies:
• That meet the definition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered
under your Plan and are not excluded;
• That are Medically Necessary; and
• That are provided in accordance with all applicable preauthorization, utilization management or other
requirements set forth in your Plan.
You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent you have not met your
Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. In addition, when you receive Covered Services from an
Out-of-Network Provider, you may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed
Amount and the Provider’s actual charges. This amount can be significant.
When you receive Covered Services from an eligible Provider, the Claims Administrator will, to the extent
applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules
evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determine the accuracy and appropriateness of
the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect the determination
of the Maximum Allowed Amount. The application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services
you received were not Medically Necessary. It means the Claims Administrator have determined that the
claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example,
your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single
procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum
Allowed Amount will be based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed
Amount for each billed code.
Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Physician or other
healthcare professional, the Maximum Allowed Amounts may be reduced for those secondary and
subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those
procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be
considered incidental or inclusive.
PROVIDER NETWORK STATUS
The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is a Network Provider or
an Out-of-Network Provider.
97
A Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network for this specific Plan or in a special
Center of Excellence/or other closely managed specialty network, or who has a participation contract with
the Claims Administrator. For Covered Services performed by a Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed
Amount for this Plan is the rate the Provider has agreed with to accept as reimbursement for the Covered
Services. Because Network Providers have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment
in full for those Covered Services, they should not send you a bill or collect for amounts above the
Maximum Allowed Amount. However, you may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the
Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent you have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or
Coinsurance. Please call Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 for help in finding a Network Provider or
visit www.anthem.com/ca.
Providers who have not signed any contract with the Claims Administrator and are not in any of the Claims
Administrator’s networks are Out-of-network Providers, subject to Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rules
governing claims filed by certain ancillary providers.
For Covered Services you receive from an Out-of-Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for
this Plan will be one of the following as determined by the Claims Administrator:
1. An amount based on the Claims Administrator Out-of-network fee schedule/rate, which the
Claims Administrator has established in its’ discretion, and which the Claims Administrator
reserves the right to modify from time to time, after considering one or more of the following:
reimbursement amounts accepted by like/similar providers contracted with the Claims
Administrator, reimbursement amounts paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
for the same services or supplies, and other industry cost, reimbursement and utilization data; or
2. An amount based on reimbursement or cost information from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (“CMS”). When basing the Maximum Allowed amount upon the level or
method of reimbursement used by CMS, the Claims Administrator will update such information,
which is unadjusted for geographic locality, no less than annually; or
3. An amount based on information provided by a third party vendor, which may reflect one or more
of the following factors: (1) the complexity or severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience
required for the treatment; or (3) comparable providers’ fees and costs to deliver care;
or
4. An amount negotiated by the Claims Administrator or a third party vendor which has been agreed
to by the Provider. This may include rates for services coordinated through case management; or
5. An amount equal to the total charges billed by the Provider, but only if such charges are less than
the Maximum Allowed Amount calculated by using one of the methods described above.
Providers who are not contracted for this product, but contracted for other products with the Claims
Administrator are also considered Out-of-Network. For this Plan, the Maximum Allowed Amount for
services from these Providers will be one of the five methods shown above unless the contract between
the Claims Administrator and that Provider specifies a different amount.
For Covered Services rendered outside Anthem's Service Area by Out-of-Network Providers, claims may
be priced using the local Blue Cross Blue Shield plan’s non-participating provider fee schedule / rate or
the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In certain situations, theMaximum
AllowedAmountfor out of area claimsmaybe based on billed charges,the pricing that would be used if the
healthcare services had been obtained within the Anthem Services Area, or a special negotiated price.
98
Unlike Network Providers, Out-of-Network Providers may send you a bill and collect for the amount of the
Provider’s charge that exceeds the Maximum Allowed Amount. You are responsible for paying the
difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount the Provider charges. This amount
can be significant. Choosing a Network Provider will likely result in lower out of pocket costs to you.
Please call Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 for help in finding a Network Provider or visit
www.anthem.com/ca.
Member Services is also available to assist you in determining this/your Plan’s Maximum Allowed Amount
for a particular service from an Out-of-Network Provider. In order to assist you, you will need to obtain
from your Provider the specific procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will
render. You will also need to know the Provider’s charges to calculate your out of pocket responsibility.
Although Member Services can assist you with this pre-service information, the final Maximum Allowed
Amount for your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted by the Provider.
MEMBER COST SHARE
For certain Covered Services, you may be required to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as
your cost share amount (for example, Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance).
Your cost share amount and Out-of-Pocket Limits may vary depending on whether you received services
from a Network or Out-of-Network Provider. Specifically, you may be required to pay higher cost sharing
amounts or may have limits on your benefits when using Out-of-Network Providers. Please see the
Schedule of Benefits in this Benefit Booklet for your cost share responsibilities and limitations, or call
Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 to learn how this Plan’s benefits or cost share amounts may vary by
the type of Provider you use.
The Claims Administrator will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You may be
responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether
such services are performed by a Network or Out-of-Network Provider. Non-Covered Services include
services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of your policy and services received after
benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, your lifetime
maximum, benefit caps or day/visit limits.
Example:
• You choose a Network surgeon. The charge was $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery
is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility when a Network surgeon is used is 10% of $1500, or $150.
The Claims Administrator pays 90% of $1500, or $1350. The Network surgeon accepts the total of
$1500 as reimbursement for the surgery regardless of the charges. Your total out of pocket
responsibility would be $150.
• You choose an Out-of-Network surgeon. The Out-of-Network surgeon’s charge for the service is
$2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery service is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility
for the Out-of-Network surgeon is 40% of $1500, or $600 after the Out-of-Network Deductible has been
met. The Claims Administrator pays the remaining 60% of $1500, or $900. In addition, the Out-ofNetwork surgeon could bill you the difference between $2500 and $1500, so your total out of pocket
charge would be $600 plus an additional $1000, for a total of $1600.
AUTHORIZED SERVICES
In some circumstances, such as where there is no Network Provider available for the Covered Service, the
Claims Administrator may authorize the Network cost share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or
Coinsurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service you receive from an Out-of-Network Provider. In
such circumstance, you must contact the Claims Administrator in advance of obtaining the Covered Service.
The Claims Administrator also may authorize the Network cost share amounts to apply to a claim for
99
Covered Services if you receive Emergency services from an Out-of-Network Provider and are not able to
contact the Claims Administrator until after the Covered Service is rendered. If the Claims Administrator
authorizes a Network cost share amount to apply to a Covered Service received from an Out-of-Network
Provider, you also may still be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Outof-Network Provider’s charge. Please contact Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 for Authorized Services
information or to request authorization.
Example:
You require the services of a specialty Provider; but there is no Network Provider for that specialty in your
state of residence. You contact the Claims Administrator in advance of receiving any Covered Services,
and they authorize you to go to an available Out-of-Network Provider for that Covered Service and they
agree that the Network cost share will apply.
Your Plan has a $45 Copayment for Out-of-Network Providers and a $25 Copayment for Network Providers
of participating providers for the Covered Service. The Out-of-Network Provider’s charge for this service is
$500. The Maximum Allowed Amount is $200.
Because the Claims Administrator has authorized the Network cost share amount to apply in this situation,
you will be responsible for the Network Copayment of $25 and the Claims Administrator will be responsible
for the remaining $175 of the $200 Maximum Allowed Amount.
Because the Out-of-Network Provider’s charge for this service is $500, you may receive a bill from the Outof-Network Provider for the difference between the $500 charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount of
$200. Combined with your Network Copayment of $25, your total out of pocket expense would be $325.
Claims Review
The Claims Administrator has processes to review claims before and after payment to detect fraud, waste,
abuse and other inappropriate activity. Members seeking services from Out-of-Network Providers could be
balanced billed by the Out-of-Network Provider for those services that are determined to be not payable as
a result of these review processes. A claim may also be determined to be not payable due to a Provider's
failure to submit medical records with the claims that are under review in these processes.
Notice of Claim & Proof of Loss
When you have received Covered Services, the Claims Administrator must receive written notice of your
claim within 90 days in order for benefits to be paid. Your claim must have the information the Claims
Administrator needs to determine benefits. Services received and charges for the services must be
itemized, and clearly and accurately described. If it is not reasonably possible to submit the claim within
that time frame, an extension of up to 12 months will be allowed. Claim forms must be used; canceled
checks or receipts are not acceptable. If the Claims Administrator is unable to complete processing
of a claim because you or your Provider fails to provide us with the additional information, the claim
may be denied.
Claim Forms
Claim forms will usually be available from most Providers. If forms are not available, contact your Student
Health Center, or via the web at: www.ucship.edu/ucship, or UC SHIP Member Services at 1-866-940-8306
and ask for a claim form to be sent to you. If you do not receive the claim form, written notice of services
rendered may be submitted without the claim form. The same information that would be given on the claim
form must be included in the written notice of claim. This includes:
• Name of patient.
100
• Patient’s relationship with the student.
• Identification number.
• Date, type, and place of service.
• Your signature and the Provider’s signature.
Member’s Cooperation
You will be expected to complete and submit to the Claims Administrator all such authorizations, consents,
releases, assignments and other documents that may be needed in order to obtain or assure
reimbursement under Medicare, Worker’s Compensation or any other governmental program. If you fail to
cooperate you will be responsible for any charge for services.
Payment of Benefits
The Claims Administrator may make benefit payments directly to Network Providers for Covered Services.
If you use an Out-of-Network Provider, however, the Claims Administrator may make benefit payments to
you. Payments may also be made to, and notice regarding the receipt and/or adjudication of claims sent
to, an Alternate Recipient (any child of a student who is recognized, under a Qualified Medical Child Support
Order (QMSCO), as having a right to enrollment under the Plan), or that person’s custodial parent or
designated representative. Any benefit payments made will discharge the Plan’s obligation to pay for
Covered Services. You cannot assign your right to benefits to anyone else, except as required by a
Qualified Medical Child Support Order as defined by any applicable state law.
Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, the Claims Administrator will not honor a request for us to
withhold payment of the claims submitted.
Inter-Plan Arrangements
Out-of-Area Services
Overview
Anthem has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Licensees. Generally, these
relationships are called “Inter-Plan Arrangements.” These Inter-Plan Arrangements work based on rules
and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (“Association”). Whenever you access
healthcare services outside the geographic area Anthem serves (the “Anthem Service Area”), the claim for
those services may be processed through one of these Inter-Plan Arrangements. The Inter-Plan
Arrangements are described below.
When you receive care outside of the Anthem Service Area, you will receive it from one of two kinds of
Providers. Most Providers (“participating providers”) contract with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield
Plan in that geographic area (“Host Blue”). Some Providers (“nonparticipating providers”) don’t contract
with the Host Blue. We explain below how we pay both kinds of Providers.
Inter-Plan Arrangements Eligibility – Claim Types
Most claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter-Plan Arrangements, as described above.
Examples of claims that are not included are Prescription Drugs that you obtain from a Pharmacy and
most dental or vision benefits.
101
A. BlueCard® Program
Under the BlueCard® Program, when you receive Covered Services within the geographic area served
by a Host Blue, Anthem will still fulfill their contractual obligations. But, the Host Blue is responsible for:
(a) contracting with its Provider; and (b) handling its interactions with those Providers.
When you receive Covered Services outside the Anthem Service Area and the claim is processed
through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay is calculated based on the lower of:
• The billed charges for Covered Services; or
• The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Anthem.
Often, this “negotiated price” will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays
to the Provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with that
Provider. Sometimes, such an arrangement may be an average price, based on a discount that results in
expected average savings for services provided by similar types of Providers.
Estimated pricing and average pricing also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or
underestimation of past pricing of claims as noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the
price Anthem uses for your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has already been paid.
B. Negotiated (non-BlueCard Program) Arrangements
With respect to one or more Host Blues, instead of using the BlueCard Program, Anthem may process
your claims for Covered Services through Negotiated Arrangements for National Accounts.
The amount you pay for Covered Services under this arrangement will be calculated based on the lower of
either billed charges for Covered Services or the negotiated price (refer to the description of negotiated
price under Section A. BlueCard Program) made available to Anthem by the Host Blue.
D. Inter-PlanPrograms: Federal/StateTaxes/Surcharges/Fees
Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharge, tax or other fee. If applicable, Anthem will
include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you.
E. Nonparticipating Providers Outside The Service Area
The pricing method used for non-participating provider claims incurred outside the Anthem Service Area
is described in "Claims Payment".
F. BCBS Global Core Program
If you Plan to travel outside the United States, call Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 to find out your
BCBS Global Core benefits. Benefits for services received outside of the United States may be different
from services received in the United States. Remember to take an up to date health Identification Card
with you.
When you are traveling abroad and need medical care, you can call the BCBS Global Core Service
Center any time. They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The toll free number is 800-
810-2583. Or you can call them collect at 804-673-1177.
If you need Inpatient Hospital care, you or someone on your behalf, should contact the Claims
Administrator for preauthorization. Keep in mind, if you need Emergency medical care, go to the nearest
hospital. There is no need to call before you receive care.
Please refer to the “Getting Approval for Benefits” section in this Benefit Booklet for further information.
102
You can learn how to get preauthorization when you need to be admitted to the Hospital for Emergency
or non-Emergency care.
How Claims are Paid with BCBS Global Core
In most cases, when you arrange Inpatient Hospital care with BCBS Global Core, claims will be filed for
you. The only amounts that you may need to pay up front are any Copayment, Coinsurance or
Deductible amounts that may apply.
You will typically need to pay for the following services up front:
• Doctor services;
• Inpatient Hospital care not arranged through BlueCard Worldwide; and
• Outpatient services.
You will need to file a claim form for any payments made up front.
When you need BlueCard Worldwide claim forms you can get international claims forms in the following
ways:
• Call the BCBS Global Core Service Center at the number above; or
• Online at www.bcbsglobalcore.com
You will find the address for mailing the claim on the form.
Note about UC Trips: The University provides a travel accident policy for students traveling on
University business which is administered by the UC Office of the President at no additional cost to the
students. For more information about this benefit and to register for the program, please go to:
https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/index.html
Please note that in order to receive emergency assistance abroad and utilize this benefit (which includes
medical evacuation and repatriation of remains while working and researching in a foreign country on
University business) you MUST register at the website listed above prior to your trip. Registration is
simple and takes less than 5 minutes.
In all instances, the University of California Office of the President travel accident policy is primary and will
pay benefits before the benefit provided under this Plan.
Coordination of Benefits When Members Are Insured Under
More Than One Plan
The coverage under this Plan is secondary coverage to all other plans (including Medicare), except
Medi-Cal, MRMIP, and TRICARE, for any services not provided by the student health services.
Services performed at the student health services are primary to any other service.
If you are covered by more than one health plan, your benefits under this Plan will be coordinated with the
benefits of those Other Plans. These coordination provisions apply separately to each Member, per Plan
Year. Any coverage you have for medical or pediatric dental benefits, will be coordinated as shown below.
DEFINITIONS
The meanings of key terms used in this section are shown below. Whenever any of the key terms shown
below appear in these provisions, the first letter of each word will be capitalized. When you see these
capitalized words, you should refer to this “Definitions” provision.
103
Allowable Expense is any necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense which is at least partially
covered by any plan covering the person for whom claim is made. When a plan provides benefits in the
form of services rather than cash payments, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be
deemed to be both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any plan
covering the person for whom a claim is made is not an Allowable Expense.
The following are not Allowable Expense:
1. Use of a private hospital room is not an Allowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private Hospital
room is Medically Necessary in terms of generally accepted medical practice, or one of the plans
routinely provides coverage for hospital private rooms.
2. If you are covered by two plans that calculate benefits or services on the basis of a reasonable and
customary amount or relative value schedule reimbursement method or some other similar
reimbursement method, any amount in excess of the higher of the reasonable and customary amounts.
3. If a person is covered by two plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated rates or
fees, an amount in excess of the lower of the negotiated rates.
4. If a person is covered by one plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of a reasonable
and customary amount or relative value schedule reimbursement method or some other similar
reimbursement method and another plan provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated
rates or fees, any amount in excess of the negotiated rate.
5. The amount of any benefit reduction by the Principal Plan because you did not comply with the plan’s
provisions is not an Allowable Expense. Examples of these types of provisions include second surgical
opinions, utilization review requirements, and network provider arrangements.
6. If you advise the Claims Administrator that all plans covering you are high deductible health plans as
defined by Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code, and you intend to contribute to a health savings
account established in accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code, any amount that is
subject to the primary high deductible health plan’s deductible.
Other Plan is any of the following:
1. Group, blanket or franchise insurance coverage;
2. Group service plan contract, group practice, group individual practice and other group prepayment
coverages;
3. Group coverage under labor-management trusteed plans, union benefit organization plans, employer
organization plans, employee benefit organization plans or self-insured employee benefit plans.
4. Medicare. This does not include Medicare when, by law, its benefits are secondary to those of any
private insurance program or other non-governmental program, including a self-insured program.
5. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) or the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics
(NAIA)
The term "Other Plan" refers separately to each agreement, policy, contract, or other arrangement for
services and benefits, and only to that portion of such agreement, policy, contract, or arrangement which
reserves the right to take the services or benefits of other plans into consideration in determining benefits.
Principal Plan is the plan which will have its benefits determined first.
This Plan is that portion of this Plan which provides benefits subject to this provision.
104
EFFECT ON BENEFITS
This provision will apply in determining a person’s benefits under This Plan for any Calendar Year if the
benefits under This Plan and any Other Plans, exceed the Allowable Expenses for that Calendar Year.
1. If This Plan is the Principal Plan, then its benefits will be determined first without taking into account
the benefits or services of any Other Plan.
2. If This Plan is not the Principal Plan, then its benefits may be reduced so that the benefits and
services of all the plans do not exceed Allowable Expense.
3. The benefits of This Plan will never be greater than the sum of the benefits that would have been paid
if you were covered under This Plan only.
ORDER OF BENEFITS DETERMINATION
The first of the following rules which applies will determine the order in which benefits are payable:
1. A member is treated at the Student Health Center. UC SHIP is primary for these services. You may
have to submit your receipt to your other health plan for reimbursement.
2. A plan which has no Coordination of Benefits provision pays before a plan which has a Coordination
of Benefits provision. This would include Medicare in all cases, except when the law requires that
This Plan pays before Medicare.
Note: This Plan is secondary coverage to all other policies except Medi-Cal, MRMIP, and TRICARE.
3. In most cases, a plan which covers you as a Member pays before a plan which covers you as a
dependent. However, UC SHIP is secondary to all other plans except Medi-Cal, MRMIP, and
TRICARE. Another exception is if you are retired and eligible for Medicare, Medicare pays (a) after
the plan which covers you as a dependent of an active employee, but (b) before the plan which
covers you as a retired employee.
THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR’S RIGHTS UNDER THIS PROVISION
Responsibility For Timely Notice. The Claims Administrator is not responsible for coordination of
benefits unless timely information has been provided by the requesting party regarding the application of
this provision.
Reasonable Cash Value. If any Other Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash
payment, the reasonable cash value of services provided will be considered Allowable Expense. The
reasonable cash value of such service will be considered a benefit paid, and our liability reduced
accordingly.
Facility of Payment. If payments which should have been made under This Plan have been made under
any Other Plan, the Claims Administrator has the right to pay that Other Plan any amount they determine
to be warranted to satisfy the intent of this provision. Any such amount will be considered a benefit paid
under This Plan, and such payment will fully satisfy the Claims Administrator’s liability under this
provision.
Right of Recovery. If payments made under This Plan exceed the maximum payment necessary to
satisfy the intent of this provision, the Claims Administrator has the right to recover that excess amount
from any persons or organizations to or for whom those payments were made, or from any insurance
company or service plan.
105
Subrogation and Reimbursement
These provisions apply when the Plan pays benefits as a result of injuries or illnesses you sustained and
you have a right to a Recovery or have received a Recovery from any source. A “Recovery” includes, but
is not limited to, monies received from any person or party, any person’s or party’s liability insurance,
uninsured/underinsured motorist proceeds, worker’s compensation insurance or fund, “no-fault” insurance
and/or automobile medical payments coverage, whether by lawsuit, settlement or otherwise. Regardless
of how you or your representative or any agreements characterize the money you receive as a Recovery,
it shall be subject to these provisions.
Subrogation
The Plan has the right to recover payments it makes on your behalf from any party responsible for
compensating you for your illnesses or injuries. The following apply:
• The Plan has first priority from any Recovery for the full amount of benefits it has paid regardless of
whether you are fully compensated, and regardless of whether the payments you receive make you
whole for your losses, illnesses and/or injuries.
• You and your legal representative must do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise the
Plan's rights and do nothing to prejudice those rights.
• In the event that you or your legal representative fails to do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan
to exercise its subrogation rights, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount the Plan paid from
any future benefits under the Plan.
• The Plan has the right to take whatever legal action it sees fit against any person, party or entity to
recover the benefits paid under the Plan.
• To the extent that the total assets from which a Recovery is available are insufficient to satisfy in full
the Plan's subrogation claim and any claim held by you, the Plan's subrogation claim shall be first
satisfied before any part of a Recovery is applied to your claim, your attorney fees, other expenses or
costs.
• The Plan is not responsible for any attorney fees, attorney liens, other expenses or costs you incur.
The ''common fund'' doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney you hire regardless
of whether funds recovered are used to repay benefits paid by the Plan.
Reimbursement
If you obtain a Recovery and the Plan has not been repaid for the benefits the Plan paid on your behalf,
the Plan shall have a right to be repaid from the Recovery in the amount of the benefits paid on your
behalf and the following provisions will apply:
• You must promptly reimburse the Plan from any Recovery to the extent of benefits the Plan paid on
your behalf regardless of whether the payments you receive make you whole for your losses,
illnesses and/or injuries.
• Notwithstanding any allocation or designation of your Recovery (e.g., pain and suffering) made in a
settlement agreement or court order, the Plan shall have a right of full recovery, in first priority,
against any Recovery. Further, the Plan’s rights will not be reduced due to your negligence.
• You and your legal representative must hold in trust for the Plan the proceeds of the gross Recovery
(i.e., the total amount of your Recovery before attorney fees, other expenses or costs) to be paid to
the Plan immediately upon your receipt of the Recovery. You and your legal representative
acknowledge that the portion of the Recovery to which the Plan's equitable lien applies is a Plan
asset.
• Any Recovery you obtain must not be dissipated or disbursed until such time as the Plan has been
repaid in accordance with these provisions.
106
• You must reimburse the Plan, in first priority and without any set-off or reduction for attorney fees,
other expenses or costs. The "common fund" doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any
attorney you hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benefits paid by the Plan.
• If you fail to repay the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct any of the unsatisfied portion of the
amount of benefits the Plan has paid or the amount of your Recovery whichever is less, from any
future benefit under the Plan if:
1. The amount the Plan paid on your behalf is not repaid or otherwise recovered by the Plan; or
2. You fail to cooperate.
• In the event that you fail to disclose the amount of your settlement to the Plan, the Plan shall be
entitled to deduct the amount of the Plan’s lien from any future benefit under the Plan.
• The Plan shall also be entitled to recover any of the unsatisfied portions of the amount the Plan has
paid or the amount of your Recovery, whichever is less, directly from the Providers to whom the Plan
has made payments on your behalf. In such a circumstance, it may then be your obligation to pay the
Provider the full billed amount, and the Plan will not have any obligation to pay the Provider or
reimburse you.
• The Plan is entitled to reimbursement from any Recovery, in first priority, even if the Recovery does not
fully satisfy the judgment, settlement or underlying claim for damages or fully compensate you or make
you whole.
Your Duties
• You must notify the Plan promptly of how, when and where an accident or incident resulting in
personal injury or illness to you occurred, all information regarding the parties involved and any other
information requested by the Plan.
• You must cooperate with the Plan in the investigation, settlement and protection of the Plan's rights.
In the event that you or your legal representative fails to do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan
to exercise its subrogation or reimbursement rights, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount
the Plan paid from any future benefits under the Plan.
• You must not do anything to prejudice the Plan's rights.
• You must send the Plan copies of all police reports, notices or other papers received in connection
with the accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to you.
• You must promptly notify the Plan if you retain an attorney or if a lawsuit is filed on your behalf.
• You must immediately notify the Plan if a trial is commenced, if a settlement occurs or if potentially
dispositive motions are filed in a case.
The Claims Administrator has sole discretion to interpret the terms of the Subrogation and Reimbursement
provision of this Plan in its entirety and reserves the right to make changes as it deems necessary.
If the covered person is a minor, any amount recovered by the minor, the minor’s trustee, guardian, parent,
or other representative, shall be subject to this provision. Likewise, if the covered person’s relatives, heirs,
and/or assignees make any Recovery because of injuries sustained by the covered person, the Recovery
shall be subject to this provision.
The Plan is entitled to recover its attorney’s fees and costs incurred in enforcing this provision.
The Plan shall be secondary in coverage to any medical payments provision, no-fault automobile insurance
policy or personal injury protection policy regardless of any election made by you to the contrary. The Plan
shall also be secondary to any excess insurance policy, including, but not limited to, school and/or athletic
policies.
107

Termination and Continuation of Coverage
Termination of Coverage
For students, coverage ends as provided below:
1. If the Plan terminates, the student’s coverage ends at the same time. This Plan may be canceled or
changed at any time without notice. If the Plan terminates or changes, an Insured student will remain
covered for claims incurred but not filed or paid prior to Plan termination or change.
2. If the Plan no longer provides coverage for the class of students to which an Insured student belongs,
the student’s coverage ends on the Effective Date of that change.
3. If the student graduates from the University, the student’s coverage continues through the last day of
the Coverage Period during which the student graduates from the University.
4. If the student withdraws or is dismissed from the University, whether or not coverage will be continued
after the date of the withdrawal or dismissal will be determined by campus policy. Contact the student
health insurance office for more information.
5. Enrollment in the Plan may be terminated for the reasons listed below. The student shall be notified in
writing of the termination. Termination shall be effective no less than 30 days following the date of the
written notice.
a. In regard to eligibility for UC SHIP, you knowingly provide material information that is false, or
misrepresents information on any document or fail to notify the Plan Administrator of changes in
your or your Dependents' status.
b. You knowingly permit the use of your Plan Identification Card by someone other than yourself or
your Dependents to obtain services; or
c. You knowingly obtain or attempt to obtain services under the Plan by means of false, materially
misleading, or fraudulent information, acts or omissions.
Enrollment in the Plan may not be terminated on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, sexual
orientation, ancestry, national origin, physical disability or disease status.
The Director of UC SHIP is responsible for the final decision on termination of enrollment in the
Plan.
109
6. If a registered student has been terminated from the Plan and has no major medical health insurance
coverage, as required by the Regents of the University of California, the student health services staff
will provide the student with assistance to find a health insurance plan that meets the University’s
minimum health benefit standards. Students may also contact coveredca.com to review Covered
California exchange plans. The student is wholly responsible for the cost of any plan in which he or
she enrolls and any medical care not covered under that plan, including costs of applying for coverage
and plan premiums.
Coverage end for Dependents, whichever occurs first.
1. When the student’s coverage ends,
2. When the Dependent no longer meets the dependent eligibility requirements,
3. At the end of each Coverage Period (unless a new enrollment form has been submitted for the next
coverage.
Important: If a marriage or domestic partnership terminates, or if a covered child loses Dependent child
status, the student must give or send AHP written notice of the termination and loss of eligibility status.
Coverage for a former Spouse or Domestic Partner, or Dependent child, if any, ends when these individuals
no longer meet eligibility criteria according to the “Eligible Status” provisions. If the Plan suffers a loss
because the student fails to notify AHP of the termination of their marriage or domestic partnership, or of
the loss of a child’s Dependent status, we may seek recovery from the student for any actual loss resulting
thereby. Failure to provide written notice to AHP will not delay or prevent termination of coverage for the
Spouse, Domestic Partner or child. If the student notifies AHP in writing to cancel coverage for a former
Spouse, Domestic Partner or child, if any, immediately upon termination of the student’s marriage, domestic
partnership or the child’s loss of Dependent child status, such notice will be considered compliant with the
requirements of this provision.
You may be entitled to continued benefits under terms which are specified elsewhere under “Continuation
of Benefits after Termination”.
Other Coverage Options after Termination. There may be other coverage options for you and/or your
family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options
(such as the plan of a Spouse or Domestic Partner). You can learn more about many of these options at
https://www.healthcare.gov/.
If you permit the use of your or any other Member’s Plan Identification Card by any other person; use
another person’s Identification Card; or use an invalid Identification Card to obtain services, your coverage
will terminate immediately upon written notice to the Group. Anyone involved in the misuse of a Plan
Identification Card will be liable to and must reimburse the Claims Administrator for the Maximum Allowed
Amount for services received through such misuse.
Should you or any family Members be receiving covered care in the Hospital at the time your membership
terminates for reasons other than your UC SHIP’s cancellation of this Plan, or failure to pay the required
premiums, benefits for Hospital Inpatient care will be provided until the date you are discharged from the
Hospital or 30 days, whichever comes first.
CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS AFTER TERMINATION
If a Member is confined as an Inpatient in a Hospital on the date of termination of the Plan or when coverage
would otherwise terminate, benefits may be continued for treatment of illness or injury for which the Member
is hospitalized. No benefits are provided for services treating any other illness, injury or condition. The
Member’s benefits will be extended for a period of 30 days provided that the Member is confined as an
Inpatient in a Hospital, under a Physician’s care, and the services are Medically Necessary. Any benefits
payable under this Plan will not exceed any benefit maximums shown under the section entitled “Schedule
of Benefits”.
110
General Provisions
Acts Beyond Reasonable Control (Force Majeure)
Should the performance of any act required by this coverage be prevented or delayed by reason of any act
of God, strike, lock-out, labor troubles, restrictive government laws or regulations, or any other cause
beyond a party’s control, the time for the performance of the act will be extended for a period equivalent to
the period of delay, and non-performance of the act during the period of delay will be excused. In such an
event, however, all parties shall use reasonable efforts to perform their respective obligations.
The Claims Administrator will adhere to the Plan Sponsor’s instructions and allow the Plan Sponsor to meet
all of the Plan Sponsor’s responsibilities under applicable state and federal law. It is the Plan Sponsor’s
responsibility to adhere to all applicable state and federal laws and the Claims Administrator does not
assume any responsibility for compliance.
All Restrictions Apply
No agent or other person, except an authorized officer of the University of California Student Health
Insurance Plan, is able to disregard any conditions or restrictions contained in this Benefit Booklet, to extend
the amount of time for making a payment to the Plan, or to bind the Plan by making any promise or
representation or by giving or receiving any information.
Care Coordination
The Claims Administrator pays Network Providers in various ways to provide Covered Services to you. For
example, sometimes they may pay Network Providers a separate amount for each Covered Service they
provide. The Claims Administrator may also pay them one amount for all Covered Services related to
treatment of a medical condition. Other times, the Claims Administrator may pay a periodic, fixed predetermined amount to cover the costs of Covered Services. In addition, the Claims Administrator may pay
Network Providers financial incentives or other amounts to help improve quality of care and/or promote the
delivery of health care services in a cost-efficient manner, or compensate Network Providers for
coordination of Member care. In some instances, Network Providers may be required to make payment to
the Claims Administrator because they did not meet certain standards. You do not share in any payments
made by Network Providers to the Claims Administrator under these programs.
Circumstances Beyond the Control of the Plan
The Claims Administrator shall make a good-faith effort to arrange for an alternative method of
administering benefits. In the event of circumstances not within the control of the Claims Administrator or
UC SHIP, including but not limited to: a major disaster, epidemic, the complete or partial destruction of
facilities, riot, civil insurrection, labor disputes not within the control of the Claims Administrator, disability of
a significant part of a Network Provider’s personnel or similar causes, or the rendering of health care
services provided by the Plan is delayed or rendered impractical the Claims Administrator shall make a
good-faith effort to arrange for an alternative method of administering benefits. In such event, the Claims
Administrator and Network Providers shall administer and render services under the Plan insofar as
practical, and according to their best judgment; but the Claims Administrator and Network Providers shall
incur no liability or obligation for delay, or failure to administer or arrange for services if such failure or delay
is caused by such an event.
111
Clerical Error
A clerical error will never disturb or affect your coverage, as long as your coverage is valid under the rules
of the Plan. This rule applies to any clerical error, regardless of whether it was the fault of the Plan or the
Claims Administrator.

The Plan may enter into a settlement or compromise regarding enforcement of these contracts and may
retain any recoveries made from a Provider or vendor resulting from these audits if the return of the
overpayment is not feasible. Additionally, the Plan has established recovery and adjustment policies to
determine which recoveries and adjustments are to be pursued, when to incur costs and expenses and
settle or compromise recovery and adjustment amounts. The Claims Administrator will not pursue
recoveries for overpayments or adjustments for underpayments if the cost of the activity exceeds the
overpayment or under payment amount.
Unauthorized Use of Identification Card

in effect or after coverage has ended, you will be liable for payment of any expenses incurred resulting from
the unauthorized use. Fraudulent misuse could also result in termination of the coverage.

in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network
who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care professional, however, may be required to
comply with certain procedures, including obtaining precertification for certain services or following a preapproved treatment plan. For a list of participating health care professionals who specialize in obstetrics or
gynecology, contact the telephone number on the back of your Identification Card at 1-866-940-8306 or
refer to our website, www.anthem.com.
Statement of Rights Under the Newborns’ and Mother’s Health
Protection Act
Group health plans and health insurance issuers generally may not, under Federal law, restrict benefits for
any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours
following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a cesarean section. However, Federal law
generally does not prohibit the mother’s or newborn’s attending Provider, after consultation with the mother,
from discharging the mother or her newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours as applicable). In any case,
plans and issuers may not, under Federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from the Plan or
the insurance issuer for prescribing a length of stay in excess of 48 hours (or 96 hours).
Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act
The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act provides for parity in the application of aggregate
treatment limitations (day or visit limits) on Mental Health and Substance Abuse benefits with dollar limits
or day/visit limits on medical/surgical benefits. In general, group health plans offering mental health and
substance abuse benefits cannot set day/visit limits on mental health or substance abuse benefits that are
lower than any such day or visit limits for medical and surgical benefits. A plan that does not impose day or
visit limits on medical and surgical benefits may not impose such day or visit limits on Mental Health and
Substance Abuse benefits offered under the plan. Also, a plan may not impose Deductibles, Copayment,
Coinsurance, and out of pocket expenses on Mental Health and Substance Abuse benefits that are more
restrictive than Deductibles, Copayment, Coinsurance, and out of pocket expenses applicable to other
medical and surgical benefits. Medical Necessity criteria are available upon request.

(“QMCSO”)

Statement of Rights Under the Women’s Cancer Rights Act of 1998
If you have had or are going to have a mastectomy, you may be entitled to certain benefits under the
Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA). For individuals receiving mastectomy-related
benefits, coverage will be provided in a manner determined in consultation with the attending Physician and
the patient, for:
• All stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy was performed;
• Surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance;
• Prostheses; and
• Treatment of physical complications of the mastectomy, including lymphedema.
These benefits will be provided subject to the same Deductibles and Coinsurance applicable to other
medical and surgical benefits provided under this Plan. (See the “Schedule of Benefits” for details.) If you
would like more information on WHCRA benefits, call Member Services at 1-866-940-8306.
Special Enrollment Notice
If you are waiving enrollment for yourself or not enrolling your Dependents (including your Spouse) because
of other health insurance coverage, you may in the future be able to enroll yourself or your Dependents in
this Plan if you or your Dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stops
contributing towards your or your Dependents’ other coverage). However, you must request enrollment
within 31 days after your or your Dependents’ other coverage ends (or after the employer stops contributing
toward the other coverage).
In addition, if you have a new Dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption,
you may be able to enroll yourself and your Dependents. However, you must request enrollment within 31
days after the marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.
Eligible student and Dependents may also enroll under two additional circumstances:
• The student’s or Dependent’s Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage is
terminated as a result of loss of eligibility; or
• The student or Dependent becomes eligible for a subsidy (state premium assistance program).
The student or Dependent must request Special Enrollment within 60 days of the loss of Medicaid/CHIP or
of the eligibility determination.
To request Special Enrollment or obtain more information, call Member Services at 1-866-940-8306, or
contact your student health services.
