Grievances relating to eligibility for coverage under the Plan should be submitted to your campus student
health insurance office in writing, within 60 days of the notification that you are not eligible for coverage.
You should include all information and documentation on which your grievance is based. The student
health insurance office will notify you in writing of its conclusion regarding your eligibility. If the student

UC SHIP Director will be final.
How Your Appeal will be Decided
When the Claims Administrator considers your appeal, the Claims Administrator’s review will not rely upon
the initial benefit determination (claim denial). The review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer
who did not make the initial determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial
determination.
Anadditional voluntary second-level review will be conducted by anappropriate reviewer who did not make
the initial determination or the first-level appeal determination and who does not work for the person who
made the initial determination or first-level appeal determination.
If the denial was based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, including whether the treatment is
experimental, investigational, or not Medically Necessary, the reviewer will consult with a health care
professional who has the appropriate training and experience in the medical field involved in making the
judgment. This health care professional will not be one who was consulted in making an earlier
determination or who works for the health care professional who was consulted in making an earlier
determination.
Notification of the Outcome of the Appeal
If you appeal a claim involving urgent/concurrent care, the Claims Administrator will notify you of the
outcome of the appeal as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of your request for
appeal.
If you appeal any other pre-service claim, the Claims Administrator will notify you of the outcome of the
appeal within 30 days after receipt of your request for appeal.
If you appeal a post-service claim, the Claims Administrator will notify you of the outcome of the appeal
within 60 days after receipt of your request for appeal.
AppealDenial
If your appeal is denied, that denial will be considered an adverse benefit determination. The notification
from the Claims Administrator will include all of the information set forth in the above subsection entitled
“Notice ofAdverse Benefit Determination.”
5
VoluntarySecond Level Appeals
If you are dissatisfied with thePlan's mandatory first level appeal decision, avoluntary second level appeal
may be available. If you would like toinitiate a second level appeal, please write totheAnthem BlueCross
address listed above. Voluntary appeals (Grievances) must be submitted within 60 calendar days of the
denial of the first level appeal. You are not required to complete a voluntary second level appeal prior to
submitting a request for an independent External Review.
External Review
If the outcome of the mandatory first level appeal is adverse to you and it was based on medical judgment,
you may be eligible for an independent External Review pursuant to federal law. You must submit your
request for External Review to the Claims Administrator within four (4) months of the notice of your final
internal adverse determination.
A request for an External Review must be in writing unless the Claims Administrator determines that it is
not reasonable to require a written statement. You do not have to re-send the information that you
submitted for internal appeal. However, you are encouraged to submit any additional information that you
think is important for review.
For pre-service claims involving urgent/concurrent care, you may proceed with an Expedited External
Review without filing an internal appeal or while simultaneously pursuing an expedited appeal through the
Claims Administrator’s internal appeal process. You or yourauthorized representative may request it orally
or in writing. All necessary information, including theClaims Administrator’s decision, can be sent between

you or your authorized representative to:
Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company
ATTN: Appeals
P.O. Box 4310,WoodlandHills, CA 91365-4310

under this health care Plan. There is no charge for you to initiate an independent External Review. The
External Review decision is final and binding on all.

Requirement to file an Appeal before filing a lawsuit

initiate proceedings in a court of law or other forum or file a claim in small claims court, depending on the
amount you areseeking. Any such action must becommenced within three yearsofthe plan's final decision
on the claim or other request for benefits. If the Plan determines an appeal is untimely, the plan's latest
decision onthe merits ofthe underlying claim orbenefit request is the final decision date. You must exhaust
the plan's internal Appeals Procedure, other than voluntary level of appeal, before filing a lawsuit or taking
other legal action, including filing a claim in small claims court against the Plan.

Types of Coverage
The types of coverage available to the Insured students and eligible Dependents are indicated at the time
of enrollment through thePlan Administrator.
When You CanEnroll
We do not require written applications from registered students. The University of California will maintain
records of all students registered each academic term and will automatically enroll all registered students
for coverage under this Plan each academic term. Students who provide proof that they have other health
coverage that meets the University’s requirements mayapply to waive enrollment in the Plan.
Students who involuntarily lose their other health coverage during the Coverage Period must notify the
student health services on their campus with an official written letter of termination from the previous health
insurance carrier. These students will be enrolled in UC SHIP as of the date of their involuntary loss of
other coverage if they notify the student health services within 31 days of the loss of their coverage. If the
student does not notify the student health services within the 31days, coveragewill be effective on the date
the student pays the full premium. The premium is not pro-rated for enrollment occurring after the start of
a Coverage Period.
Non-registered students and eligible Dependentswho enroll on a voluntarybasismust submit an
electronic enrollment application for eachacademic term ofcoverage. Enrollment applicationsmustbe
received within 30 days of the start of the coverage period. The coverage will begin on the first day of that
period. Enrollment will not be continued to the next Coverage Period (academic term) unless
a new electronic application is received. Areminder of re-enrollment will be provided, but it is the
student’s responsibility to make sure their coverage continues to next term by contacting AHP.
To enroll a Dependent, you may either contact AHP Customer Care Unit at 1-855-871-9549 or complete
the online enrollment application found on your campus Student Health Center web page. Your
dependents must meet all Dependent eligibility criteria established by the Plan Administrator, and be one
of the following.
14
Dependents ofcovered students may be enrolled,outside ofan enrollment period foraparticularCoverage
Period, within 31 calendar days of the following events:
1. For Spouse, the date of issuance of the marriage certificate.
2. For a Domestic Partner, the date that the Certificate of Registered Domestic Partnership is filed with
theState ofCalifornia orotherjurisdiction.
3. For a biological child, the date of birth.
4. For an adopted or foster child, the date of placement with the student or Domestic Partner.
5. For any Dependent, the date of loss of other coverage. An official letter of termination from the
insurance carrier must be provided at the time of enrollment in UC SHIP.
6. For a child covered under a court order, the date that the court orders that the child be covered.
Non-registered students and eligible Dependents enrollbycontacting AHP at1-855-871-9549.
Important Note Regarding Newborn Children. If the student is already covered, any child born to the
student will be covered under thestudent’s benefits from the moment ofbirth, provided Anthem BlueCross
is notified of the birth within 31 days. Coverage will be in effect for 31 days under the covered parent’s plan
without additional cost tothestudent. Ifboth parents are UC SHIP members, the newborn coverage will be
assigned to themother for the first 31 days.
For continued newborn coverage beyond the 31 days described in the preceding paragraph, the parent
must enroll the newborn as a Dependent under UC SHIP within 31 days of the date of birth. The student
must contact AHP at 1-855-871-9549 or complete the electronic enrollment application on your campus
Student Health Center website to enroll the child as a Dependent.
Special Enrollment Periods
If a student or Dependent does not enroll for coverage when they were first eligible, theymay be able to
join the Plan if they qualify for Special Enrollment. The student or Dependent must request Special
Enrollment within 31 days of a qualifying event.
Special Enrollmentis available for eligible individuals who:
 Lost eligibility under a prior health plan for reasons other than non-payment of premium or due to
fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a materialfact.
 Exhausted COBRA benefits orPlan Administrator contributions toward coverage were
terminated.
 Lost employer contributions towards the cost of theother coverage
 Are noweligible for coverage due to marriage, domestic partnership, birth, adoption, or
placement foradoption.
15
Nondiscrimination
No person who is eligible to enroll will be refused enrollment based on health status, health care needs,
genetic information, previous medicalinformation, disability,sexual orientation or identity, gender or age.
Statements and Forms
All Members must complete forms or statements that the Plan may reasonably request.
Any rights to benefits under this Plan are subject to the condition that all such information is true, correct,
and complete. Any material misrepresentation by you mayresult in termination of coverage as provided
in the “Termination and Continuation of Coverage” section. This does not apply, however, to fraudulent
misstatements.
16
How Your Plan Works
IF YOU ARE ENROLLED UNDER THIS PLAN AS A STUDENT AND YOU NEED NON-EMERGENCY
OR NON-URGENT MEDICAL CARE, YOU MUST FIRST GO TO OR CONTACT THE STUDENT
HEALTH SERVICES FOR TREATMENT DURING THEIR REGULAR HOURS OF OPERATION. THE
STUDENT HEALTH SERVICES WILL HELP YOU LOCATE PROVIDERS AND ISSUE REFERRALS
TO MEDICAL PROVIDERS WHEN ADDITIONAL CARE OR A SPECIALIST IS NEEDED. COVERED
DEPENDENTS MUST SEEK CARE FROM OFF-CAMPUS PROVIDERS AND DO NOT REQUIRE
REFERRALS.
Student HealthServices (SHS)is the student’smedical home. You may choose from amongSHS providers
for your primary, wellness care, some specialty care, and other services. Your SHS Provider will diagnose
and treat most illnesses, coordinate all of your health care and provide a Referral if you need care outside
the SHS. With the Referral in hand you choose from Network Providers or Out-of-Network Providers.
Review the benefits listed in this Benefit Booklet to determine your most cost-effective option.
Referrals are made at the sole and absolute discretion of the SHS. The Referral does not guarantee
payment or coverage, and your Deductible, Copayment or Coinsurance may apply. The services you
obtain must be Medically Necessary and a covered benefit under this Plan. Exceptions: students are not
required to obtain a SHS referral for Emergency or urgent care, LiveHealth Online, pediatric dental or vision
for members under age 19, services of a pediatrician, obstetrician, or gynecologist, or from providers 50
miles from campus.
IF A STUDENT RECEIVES MEDICAL CARE WITHOUT PRIOR REFERRAL FROM THE STUDENT
HEALTH SERVICES, THE EXPENSES WILL NOT BE COVERED, EXCEPT FOR THE EXCEPTIONS
LISTEDABOVE.
Note: Student Health Services (SHS) on campus does not provide medical, pharmacy, dental and vision
services for covered Dependents. Covered Dependents may seek medical services off campus from any
health care professional or Facility without the need of referral.
Network Services
Your Plan is a PPO plan. The Plan is divided into two sets of benefits: Network and Out-of-Network. If
you choose a Network Provider, you will pay less in out-of-pocket costs, such as Copayments,
Deductibles, and Coinsurance. If you use an Out-of-Network Provider, you will have to pay more in outof-pocket expenses.
When you use a Network Provider or get care as part of an Authorized Service, Covered Services will be
covered at the Network level. The Claims Administrator has final authority to determine the Medical
Necessity of the service. Referrals are required from the Student Health Services to visit a Network
Specialist, including behavioral health Providers. Thisdoesnot apply to Emergency care, urgent care,
LiveHealth Online, pediatric dental or vision for membersunder age 19, servicesof a pediatrician,
obstetrician, orgynecologist or from providers 50 miles from campus.
17
Network Providers include various types of "Network Providers" who contract with the Claims
Administrator to care for you. These providers are called "Network Providers" because they have agreed
to participate in the Claims Administrator’s preferred provider organization program (PPO), called the
Prudent Buyer Plan. Network Providers have agreed to rates they will accept as reimbursement for
Covered Services. The cost of benefits provided under this Plan will generally be lower for Network
Providers than for Out-of-Network Providers. Referrals are required from the Student Health Services in
order to visit a Network Specialist, including behavioral health Providers. This does not apply to
Emergency care, urgent care, LiveHealth Online, pediatric dental or vision for membersunder age
19, servicesof a pediatrician, obstetrician, or gynecologist or from providers 50 miles from campus.
The University of California fivehealth systems, including hospitals, andother medicalfacilities, and
affiliated professional providershave agreed to specialdiscounted rates for UC SHIP members.
Upon receiving the Referral to see a Doctor, call their office:
 Tell them you are an Anthem Member,
 Have your Member Identification Card handy. The Doctor’s office may ask you for your group or
MemberID number.
 Tell them the reason for your visit.
When you go to the office, be sure to bring your Member Identification Card with you. You can provide a
copy from your student health mobile app (mobilehealthconsumer/student from the App Store or Google
Play).
For services rendered by Network Providers:
1. You will not be required to file any claims. Network Providers will file claims for Covered Services for
you. (You will still need to pay any Coinsurance, Copayments, and/or Deductibles that apply.) You
may be billed by your Network Provider(s) for any non-Covered Services you get or when you have
not followed with the terms of this Benefit Booklet.
2. Precertification will be done by the Network Provider. See the “Getting Approval for Benefits” section
for further details.
Please refer tothe “Claims Payment” section for additional information on Authorized Services.
Note: Payment of Emergencyroom claims is subject to reviewby the Claims Administrator. The Claims
Administrator makes thefinal determination regarding whether services wererendered foran Emergency.
Contractingand Non-Contracting Hospitalsare another type of service providers. They are different
from a Hospital which is a Network Provider. The Claims Administrator has contracted with most
hospitals in California to obtain certain advantages for patients covered under the Plan. While only some
hospitals are Network Providers, all eligible California hospitals are invited tobe Contracting Hospitals
and most--over 90%--accept. Forthose which do not (called Non-Contracting Hospitals), there isa
significant benefit penalty in your Plan.
18
Out-of-NetworkServices and Benefits
Services which are not obtained from a Network Provider or as part of an Authorized Service will be
considered an Out-of-Network service, unless otherwise indicated in this Benefit Booklet. You must
obtain a Referral from the Student Health Center to seek treatment from an Out-of-Network provider,
except for items listed above.
For services rendered by anOut-of-Network Provider:
1. The Out-of-Network Provider can charge you the difference between their bill and the Plan’s
Maximum AllowedAmountplus any Deductible and/orCoinsurance/Copayments;
2. You may have higher cost sharing amounts (i.e., Deductibles,Coinsurance,and/or Copayments);
3. You will have to pay for services that are not Medically Necessary;
4. You will have to pay non-Covered Services;
5. You may have to file claims; and
6. You must make sure anynecessary Precertification is done. Please see the “Obtaining Approval for
Benefits” sectionfor further details.
Exceptionsto Out-of-NetworkServicesand Benefits:
Your Co-Insurance for Out-of-Network Providers will be the same as for Network Providers for the
following services. You may be responsible for charges which exceed the Maximum Allowed Amount.
a. Emergency services provided by other than a Hospital;
b. The first 48 hours of Emergency services provided by a hospital (the Network Provider Co-Insurance
will continue to applyto an Out-of-Network Provider beyond the first 48 hours if you, in the Claims
Administrator’s judgment, cannot besafely moved);
c. The services of an Out-of-Network Provider when Anthem approves a referral from a Physician who
is a Network Provider or from the student health services (see the provision AUTHORIZED SERVICES on
page 101);
d. Charges by a type of Physician not represented in the Prudent Buyer Plan network (for example, an
audiologist);
e. Clinical Trials; or
f. The services of an anesthesiologist and assistant surgeon who are Out-of-Network Providers when
the Hospital where the surgery is to be performed, or Ambulatory Surgical Facility, AND the operating
Physicianare BOTHNetwork Providers.
Note: Payment of Emergencyroom claims is subject to reviewby the Claims Administrator. The Claims
Administrator makes thefinal determination regarding whether services wererendered foran Emergency.
19
How to Find a Providerin the Network
There are three ways you can find out if a Provider or Facility is in the Claims Administrator’s network.
You can also find out where they are located and details about their license or training:
 See your Plan’s directoryof Network Providers at www.anthem.com/ca, choose a plan/network - UC
SHIP PPO, which lists the Physicians, Providers, and Facilities that participate in this Plan’s network.
 Call Member Services to request a list of Physicians and Providers that participate in this Plan’s
network, based on specialtyand geographic area.
 Check with your Physician or Provider.
Please note that not all Network Providers offer all services. For example, some hospital-based labs are
not part of our Reference Lab Network. In those cases you will have to go to a lab in the Reference Lab
Network to get Network benefits. Please call Member Services before you get services for more
information.
If you need details about a Provider’s license or training, or help choosing a Physician who is right for
you, call the Member Services number on the back of your Member Identification Card (1-866-940-
8366). TTY/TDD services also are available by dialing 711. A special operator will get intouch with the
Claims Administrator to help with your needs.
Please note that Anthem has several networks, please make sure to choose the UC SHIP PPO network
when choosing a provider.
Timely Access to Care
Anthem has contracted with health care service providers to provide Covered Services in a manner
appropriate for your condition, consistent with good professional practice. Anthem ensures that its
contracted provider networks have the capacity and availability to offer appointments within the
following timeframes:
 Urgent Care appointments for services that do not require prior authorization: within fortyeight (48) hours of the request for an appointment;
 UrgentCare appointmentsfor services that require prior authorization: within ninety-six (96)
hours of the request for an appointment;
 Non-Urgent appointments for primary care: within ten (10) business days of the request for an
appointment;
 Non-Urgent appointmentswith specialists: within fifteen (15) business days of the request for
anappointment;
Emergency ServicesProvided by Out-of-Network Providers. Out-of-Network Providers may send
you a bill and collect forthe amount of theOut-of-Network Provider’s charge that exceeds the Maximum
Allowed Amount under this Plan. You areresponsible for paying the difference between the Maximum
Allowed Amount and the amount theOut-of-Network Provider charges. This amount can be significant.
If you receive a bill, please contact your campus studenthealth services insurance office at 1-805-893-
8592 for additional information or assistance. Covered Dependents must contact the Claims
Administrator at 1-866-940-8306 foradditional information orassistance.
20
If a Provider determines that the waiting time for an appointment can be extended without a
detrimental impact on yourhealth, the Provider may schedule an appointment for a later time
than noted above.
Anthem arranges for telephone triage or screening services for you twenty-four (24) hours per day,
seven (7) days per week with a waiting time of no more than thirty(30) minutes. If Anthem contracts
with a Provider for telephone triage or screening services, the Provider will utilize a telephone
answering machine and/or an answering service and/or office staff, during and after business hours,
to inform you of the wait time for a return call from the Provider or how the Member may obtain urgent
care or Emergency services or howto contact another Provider who is on-call for telephone triage or
screening services.
If you need the services of an interpreter, the services will be coordinated with scheduled
appointments and will not result in a delayof an appointment with a Network Provider.
The BlueCard Program
Like all Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans throughout the country, the Claims Administrator participates in
a program called "BlueCard," which provides services to you when you are outside the Service Area. For
more details on this program, please see “Inter-Plan Arrangements” in the“Claims Payment” section.
Identification Card
A health app is also available that allows UC SHIP Members and their Dependents to access Plan
Identification Cards and benefits information from their mobile devices. To learn more about these
services, please call UC SHIP Member Services at 1-866-940-8306 or download the app from the App
Store orGoogle play (mobilehealthconsumer/student)todownload the StudentHealth app.Once you
have the app, follow these three steps to register:
1. Enter you first name, last name, student ID number and date of birth (mm/dd/yyyy); then go to the
next screen.
2. On the next screen, called Credentials, notice your assigned user name. For most students, your
username is, "firstname.lastname"but if another student in the UC system has the same name,
you will be assigned a user name with the number "1," "2" or so on after it.
3. Create a password containingat least six characters, including a letter and number.
The Claims Administrator will provide an electronic Identification Card to each Member enrolled in the
Plan. When you get care, you must show your Identification Card. Only covered Members have the right
to receive services under this Plan. If anyone gets services or benefits to which they are not entitled to
under the terms of this Benefit Booklet, he/she must pay for the actual cost of the services.
You may not knowingly permit the use of your Plan Identification Card by someone other than yourself or
your dependents toobtain services.

Schedule of Benefits
In this section you will find an outline of the benefits included in your Plan and a summary of any
Deductibles,Coinsurance, andCopayments that you mustpay. Also listed are any Benefit YearMaximums
or limits that apply. Please read the "What’s Covered" for more details on the Plan’s Covered Services.
Read the “What’s Not Covered” section for details on Excluded Services.
All Covered Services are subject to the conditions, exclusions, limitations, and terms of this Benefit Booklet
including any endorsements,amendments,orriders.
To get the highest benefits at the lowest out-of-pocket cost, you must get Covered Services from a
Network Provider. Benefits for Covered Services are based on the Maximum AllowedAmount, which is
the most the Plan will allow for a Covered Service. When you use an Out-of-Network Provider you may
have to pay the difference between the Out-of-Network Provider’s billed charge and the Maximum Allowed
Amount in addition toany Coinsurance, Copayments,Deductibles,and non-covered charges. This amount
can be substantial. Please read the “Claims Payment” section for more details.
Certain services require prior authorization in order for benefits to be provided. Network Providers will
initiate the review on your behalf. An Out-of-Network Provider may or may not initiate the review for you.
In both cases, it is your responsibility to initiate the process and ask your Physician to request prior
authorization. You may also call Anthem directly. Please see “Getting Approval for Benefits” for more
details.
Deductibles, Coinsurance, and Benefit Year Maximums are calculated based upon the Maximum Allowed
Amount, not the Provider’s billed charges.
Essential Health Benefitsprovided within this Benefit Booklet are not subject to lifetime or annual
dollar maximums. Certain non-essential health benefits, however, are subject to either a lifetime
and/or dollar maximum.

24
Important Notice about Your CostShares
For certainCovered Services, and depending on your Plan design, you may berequired to pay all or a part
of the Maximum Allowed Amount as your cost share amount (Deductibles, Coinsurance or Copayments).
Your cost share amount may be different depending on whether you received Covered Services from a
Network Provider or Out-of-Network Provider. Specifically, you may be required to pay higher cost-share
amounts or may have limits on your benefits when using Out-of-Network Providers. Please see the
“Schedule of Benefits” section for your cost share responsibilities and limitations, or call the Member
Services telephone number (1-866-940-8306) on your Identification Card to learn how this Plan’s benefits
or cost share amount may vary by the type of Provider you use.
The Claims Administrator will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You may be
responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether
such services are performed by a Network Provider or Out-of-Network Provider. Non-Covered Services
include services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of your Plan and services received after
benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, Medical Benefit
Maximumsorday/visit limits.
In some instances you may only be asked to pay the lower Network Provider cost share percentage when
you use an Out-of-Network Provider. For example, if you go to a Network Hospital or Facility and receive
Covered Services from an Out-of-Network Provider such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist
providing services at the Hospital or Facility, you will pay the Network Provider cost share percentage of
the Maximum Allowed Amount for those Covered Services. However, you also may be liable for the
difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out-of-Network Provider’s charge, called
“Balance Billing.” (Please see above exceptions for Out-of-Network Services and Benefits.) (Please see
aboveexceptions forOut-of-Network ServicesandBenefits.)
The tables below outline the Plan’s Covered Services and the cost share(s) you must pay. In many spots
you will see the statement, “Benefits are based on the setting in which Covered Services are received.” In
these cases you should determine where you will receive the service (i.e., in a Doctor’s office, at an
outpatient Hospital Facility, etc.) and look up that location to find out which cost share will apply. For
example, you might get physical therapy in a Doctor’s office, an outpatient Hospital Facility, or during an
Inpatient Hospital stay. For services in the office, look up “Office Visits.” For services in the outpatient
department of a hospital, look up“Outpatient FacilityServices.” For services during an Inpatient stay, look
up “Inpatient Services.”

Getting Approval for Benefits
Most services require a Referral from the Student Health Center before seeking care off campus, except
for Emergency care, urgent care, Live Health Onlinepediatric dental or vision for members under age
19, services of a pediatrician, obstetrician, or gynecologist or from providers 50 miles from campus. Your
Plan also includes the process of Utilization Review to decide when services are Medically Necessary
or Experimental/Investigational as those terms are defined in this Benefit Booklet. Utilization Review aids
the delivery of cost-effective health care by reviewing the use of treatments and, when proper, level of
care and/or the setting or place of service that they are performed
Reviewing Where Services Are Provided
A service must be Medically Necessary to be a Covered Service. When level of care, setting or place of
service is part of the review, services that can be safely given to you in a lower level of care or lower cost
setting / place of care, will not be Medically Necessary if they are given in a higher level of care, or higher
cost setting / place of care. This means that a request for a service may be denied because it is not
Medically Necessary for the service to be provided where it is being requested. When this happens the
service can be requested again in another place and will be reviewed again for Medical Neces sity. At times
a different provider or facility my need to be used in order for the service to be considered Medically
Necessary. Examples include, but are not limited to:
 A service may be denied on an inpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable if provided on an
outpatient basis at a Hospital.
 A service may be denied on an outpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable at a free standing
imaging center, infusion center, Ambulatory Surgical Facility, or in a Physician’s office.
 A service may be denied at a Skilled Nursing Facility but may be approvable in a home setting.
Utilization Review criteria will be based on many sources including medical policy and clinical guidelines.
Anthem may decide that a treatment that was asked for is not Medically Necessary if a clinically equivalent
treatment that is more cost effective is available and appropriate. “Clinically equivalent” means treatments
that for most Members, will give you similar results for a disease or condition.
If you have any questionsabout the information inthissection, you maycalltheUCSHIP MemberServices
at 1-866-940-8306.
Coverage for orpayment of the serviceortreatment reviewed isnot guaranteed evenif it'sdecided
your services are Medically Necessary. Forbenefits to be covered, on the date you get service:
1. You must be eligible for benefits;
2. Premium must be paid for the time period that services are given;
3. The service or supply must be a Covered Service under your Plan;
4. The service cannot be subject to an Exclusion under your Plan; and
5. You must not have exceeded anyapplicable limits under your Plan.

Types of Reviews
 Pre-service Review– A review of a service, treatment or admission for a coverage determination
which is done before the service or treatment begins or admission date.
 Precertification – A required Pre-service Review, for a benefit coverage determination for a
service or treatment. Certain services require Precertification in order for you to get benefits. The
benefit coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of
Medical Necessity or is Experimental / Investigational as those terms are defined in this Benefit

 Predetermination – Anoptional, voluntary Reviewrequest for a benefit coverage determination
for a service or treatment if there is a related clinical coverage guideline. The benefit coverage
review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical

treatment. Urgent reviews are conducted under ashorter timeframe than standard reviews.
 Post-service Review– A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage that is
conducted after the service has been provided. Post-service Reviews are performed when a service,
treatment or admission did not need a Precertification, or when a needed Precertification was not
obtained or a Predetermination review was not performed. Post-service Reviews are done for a
service, treatment or admission in which the Claims Administrator has a related clinical coverage
guideline and are typically initiated bythe Claims Administrator.

Who is Responsible forPrecertification?
Typically, Network Providers know which services need Precertification and will get any Precertification
when needed, or ask for a Predetermination, even though it is not required. Your Primary Care Physician
and other Network Providers have been given detailed information about these procedures and they are
responsible for meeting these requirements. If services are requested at an out-of-network, nonparticipating provider, or Blue Card provider, you are responsible to obtain the Precertification. When you
are travelling abroad and need medical care, you can call Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service
Center any time. They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Generally, the orderingProvider,
Facility or attending Doctor (“requesting Provider”) will get in touch with the Claims Administrator to ask for
a Precertification or Predetermination review. However, you may request a Precertification or
Predetermination or you may choose an authorized representative to act on your behalf for a specific
request. The authorized representative can be anyone who is 18 years of age or older. The table below
outlines who is responsible for Precertification andunder what circumstances.

How DecisionsRegarding Medical Necessity are Made
The Claims Administrator will use clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy, clinical guidelines,
and other applicable policies to help make Medical Necessity decisions. Medical policies and clinical
guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions identified as proper medical practice.
The Claims Administrator reserves the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines from
time to time.
You are entitled to ask for and get, free of charge, reasonable access to any records concerning your
request. To ask for this information, call the Precertification phone number at 1-800-274-7767, which also
appears on the back of your Identification Card.

53
Important Information
The Claims Administrator may, from time to time, waive, enhance, change or end certain medical
management processes(including utilization management,case management, anddisease management)
and/or offer an alternate benefit if inits sole discretion, suchchange furthers the provision of cost effective,
value based and/or quality services.
The Claims Administrator may also select certainqualifyingProviders totake part inaprogram oraprovider
arrangement that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would
otherwise apply. The Claims Administrator may also exempt your claim from medical review if certain
conditions apply.
Just because the Claims Administrator exempts a process, Provider or Claim from the standards which
otherwise would apply, it does not mean that theClaims Administrator will do so in the future, or will do so
in the future for any other Provider, claim or Member. The Claims Administrator may stop or change any
such exemption with or without advance notice.
You may find out whether a Provider is taking part in certain programs by contacting the Member
Services number at1-866-940-8306, which is indicated on the back of your Identification Card.
The Claims Administrator also may identifycertainProviders to reviewfor potential fraud, waste, abuse or
other inappropriate activity if the claims data suggests there maybe inappropriate billing practices. If a
Provider is selected under this program, then theClaims Administrator may use one or more clinical
utilization management guidelines in the review of claims submitted by this Provider, even if those
guidelines are not used for all Providers delivering services to this Plan’s Members.
HealthPlan Individual Case Management
Our health plan individual case managementprograms (Case Management) helpscoordinate services for
Members with health-care needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic health conditions. The Claims
Administrator’s programs coordinate benefits and educate Members who agree to take part in the Case
Management Program to help meet theirhealth-related needs.
Case Management programs are confidential and voluntaryand are made available at no extra cost to
you. These programs are provided by, or on behalf of and at the request of, your health plan case
management staff. These Case Management programs are separate from anyCovered Services you are
receiving.
If you meet program criteria and agree to take part in, the Claims Administrator will help you meet your
identified health care needs. This is reached through contact and team work with you and/or your chosen
authorized representative, treatingPhysician(s),andotherProviders.
In addition, theClaims Administrator may assist with coordinating care with existing community-based
programs and services to meet your needs. This may include giving you information about external
agencies andcommunity-based programsand services.
In certain cases of severe or chronic illness or injury, the Plan may provide benefits for alternate care that
is not listed as a Covered Service. The Plan may also extend Covered Services beyond the Benefit Year
Maximums of this Plan. The Claims Administrator will make its decision case-by-case, if in the Claims
Administrator’s discretion the alternate or extended benefit is in the best interest of you and the Plan, and
you or your authorized representative agree to the alternate or extended benefit in writing. A decision to
provide extended benefits or approve alternate care in one case does not obligate the Plan to provide the
same benefits again to you or to any other Member. The Plan reserves the right, at any time, toalter or
stop providing extended benefits or approving alternate care. In such case, the Claims Administrator will
notify you or your authorized representative in writing.
54
Acute Care at Home Programs
Anthem has programs available that offer acute care to Members where they live as an alternative to staying
in a Facility, when the Member’s condition and the Covered Services to be delivered, are appropriate for the
home setting. The Claims Administrator refers to these programs as Acute Care at Home Programs. These
programs provide care for active, short-term treatment of a severe injury or episode of illness, an urgent
medical condition, or during recovery from surgery. Acute care services are generally delivered by teams
of health care Providers from a range of medical and surgical specialties. The Acute Care at Home Programs
are separate from the Plan’s Home Care Services benefit, are only available in certain Service Areas, and
are only provided if the Member’s home meets accessibility requirements.
Covered Services provided by Acute Care at Home Programs may include Physician services (either inperson or via telemedicine), diagnostic services, surgery, home care services, home infusion therapy,
Prescription Drugs administered by a Provider, therapy services, and follow-up care in the community. Acute
Care at Home Programs may also include services required to set up telemedicine technology for in-home
patient monitoring, and may include coverage for meals.
Members who qualify for these programs will be contacted by the Provider, who will discus s how treatment
will be structured, and what costs may be required for the services. Benefit limits that might otherwise apply
to outpatient or home care services, (e.g., home care visits, physical therapy, etc.), may not apply to these
programs.
Your participation in these programs is voluntary. If you choose to participate, your Provider will discuss the
length of time that benefits are available under the program (e.g., the Acute Care at Home Benefit Period)
when you enroll. The Acute Care at Home Benefit Period typically begins on the date your Acute Care at
Home Provider sets up services in your home, and lasts until the date you are discharged from the Program.
Any Covered Services received before or after the Acute Care at Home Benefit Period will be covered
according to the other benefits of this Plan.

Important Notes on Air Ambulance Benefits
Benefits are only available for air ambulance when it is not appropriate to use a ground or water
ambulance. For example, if using a ground ambulance would endanger your health and your medical
condition requires a more rapid transport to a Facility than the ground ambulance can provide, the Plan
will cover the air ambulance. Air ambulance will also be covered if you are in an area that a ground or
waterambulance cannot reach.
Air ambulance will not be covered if you are taken to a hospital that is not an acute care hospital (such as a
skilled nursing facility or a rehabilitation facility), or if you are taken to a physician’s office or to your home.
Hospital to Hospital Transport
If you are moving from one Hospital to another, air ambulance will only be covered if using a ground
ambulance would endanger your health and if the Hospital that first treats cannot give you the medical
services you need. Certain specialized services are not available at all Hospitals. For example, burn care,
cardiac care, trauma care, and critical care areonly available at certain Hospitals. To be covered, you must
be taken to the closest Hospital that can treat you. Coverage is not available for air ambulance transfers
simply because you, your family, or your Provider prefers a specific Hospital or Physician.

Physician determines that your condition requires the use of services that only a licensed ambulance (or
psychiatric transport van) can provide and that the use of other means of transportation would endanger

toreceive ongoing payments for your orthodontic treatment.
Payments for treatment are made: 1. when treatment begins (appliances are installed), and 2. at six (6)

Before treatment begins, the treating dentist should submit a pre-treatment estimate to us. An Estimate
of Benefits form will be sent to you and your dentist indicating the estimated Maximum Allowed Amount,
including any amount (Coinsurance) you may owe. This form serves as a claim form when treatment
begins.
When treatment begins, the dentist should submit the Estimate of Benefit form with the date of appliance
placement and his/her signature. After benefit and eligibility verification by us, a payment will be issued.
A new/revised Estimate of Benefits form will also be issued to you and your dentist. This again will serve
as the claim form to be submitted six (6) months from the date of appliance placement.

Claims Payment
This section describes how the Claims Administrator reimburses claims and what information is needed
when you submit a claim. When you receive care from a Network Provider, you do not need to file a claim
because the Network Provider will do this for you. If you receive care from an Out-of-Network Provider,
you will need to make sure aclaim is filed. Many Out-of-Network Hospitals,Physicians and other Providers
will still submit your claim for you, although they are not required to do so. If you submit the claim, use a
claim form as described later in this section.
Maximum Allowed Amount
GENERAL
This section describes how theClaims Administrator determines the amount of reimbursementfor
Covered Services. Reimbursement for services renderedby Network andOut-of-Network Providers is
based on this Plan’s Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that you receive. Please see
"Inter-Plan Arrangements" section foradditional information.
The Maximum Allowed Amount is the maximum amount of reimbursement this Plan will allow for services
andsupplies:
 That meet the definition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered
under your Plan and are not excluded;
 That are Medically Necessary;and
 That are provided in accordance with all applicable preauthorization, utilization management or other
requirements set forth in your Plan.
You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent you have not met your
Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. In addition, when you receive Covered Services from an
Out-of-Network Provider, you may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed
Amount and the Provider’s actual charges. This amount can be significant.
When you receive Covered Services from an eligible Provider, the Claims Administrator will, to the extent
applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules
evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determine the accuracy and appropriateness of
the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect the determination
of the Maximum AllowedAmount. The application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services
you received were not Medically Necessary. It means the Claims Administrator have determined that the
claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example,
your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single
procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum
Allowed Amount will be based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed
Amount for each billed code.
Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Physician or other
healthcare professional, the Maximum Allowed Amounts may be reduced for those secondary and
subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those
procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be
considered incidental orinclusive.
10
0
PROVIDERNETWORKSTATUS
The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is a Network Provider or
anOut-of-Network Provider.
A Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network forthis specific Plan orin a special Center
of Excellence/or other closely managed specialty network, or who has a participation contract with the
Claims Administrator. For Covered Services performed by a Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed
Amount for this Plan is the rate the Provider has agreed with to accept as reimbursement for the Covered
Services. Because Network Providers have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment
in full for thoseCovered Services, they should not send you abill or collect foramounts above the Maximum
Allowed Amount. However, you may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum
Allowed Amount to the extent you have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance.
Please call Member Services for help in finding a Network Provider or visit www.anthem.com.
Providers who have not signed any contract with the Claims Administrator and are not inany of the Claims
Administrator’s networks are Out-of-network Providers, subject to Blue Cross Blue ShieldAssociation rules
governing claims filed by certain ancillaryproviders.
For Covered Services you receive from anOut-of-Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for
this Plan will be one of the following as determined by the Claims Administrator:
1. Anamount based on theClaims Administrator Out-of-network fee schedule/rate, which the
Claims Administrator has established in its’ discretion, and which the Claims Administrator
reserves the right to modify from time to time, after considering one or more of the following:
reimbursement amountsaccepted by like/similar providers contracted with theClaims
Administrator,reimbursement amounts paid by theCenters forMedicare and Medicaid Services
for the same services or supplies, and other industrycost, reimbursement and utilization data; or
2. An amount based on reimbursement or cost information from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (“CMS”). When basing the Maximum Allowed amount upon the level or
method of reimbursement used by CMS, the Claims Administrator will update such information,
which is unadjusted for geographic locality, no less than annually; or
3. An amount based on information provided by a third party vendor, which mayreflect one or more
of the following factors: (1) the complexityor severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience
required for the treatment; or (3) comparable providers’ fees and costs to deliver care;
or
4. An amount negotiated by the Claims Administrator or a third party vendor which has been agreed
to by the Provider. This may include rates for services coordinated through case management; or
5. An amount equal to the total charges billed by the Provider, but only if such charges are less than
the Maximum Allowed Amount calculated by using one of the methods described above.
Providers who are not contracted for this product, but contracted for other products with the Claims
Administrator are also considered Out-of-Network. For this Plan, the Maximum Allowed Amount for
services from these Providers will be one of the five methods shown above unless the contract between
theClaims Administrator and that Provider specifies a different amount.
For Covered Services rendered outsideAnthem's ServiceArea by Out-of-Network Providers, claimsmay
be priced using the local Blue Cross Blue Shield plan’s non-participating provider fee schedule / rate or
the pricing arrangements required byapplicable state or federal law. Incertain situations,theMaximum
Allowed Amount forout ofareaclaims may bebasedonbilledcharges, the pricingthat would be used if the
healthcare services had been obtainedwithin the Anthem Services Area, or a special negotiated price.
100
Unlike Network Providers, Out-of-Network Providers may send you a bill and collect for the amount of the
Provider’s charge that exceeds the Maximum Allowed Amount. You are responsible for paying the
difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount theProvider charges. This amount
can be significant. Choosing a Network Provider will likelyresult in lower out of pocket costs to you.
Please call Member Services for help in finding a Network Provider or visit www.anthem.com.
Member Services is also available to assist you in determining this/your Plan’s Maximum Allowed Amount
for a particular service from an Out-of-Network Provider. In order to assist you, you will need to obtain
from your Provider the specific procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will
render. You will also need to know theProvider’s charges to calculate your out of pocket responsibility.
Although Member Services can assist you with this pre-service information, the final Maximum Allowed
Amount for your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted by the Provider.
MEMBERCOSTSHARE
For certain Covered Services, you mayberequired to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as your
cost share amount (forexample, Deductible,Copayment,and/orCoinsurance).
Your cost share amount and Out-of-Pocket Limits may vary depending on whether you received services
from a Network or Out-of-Network Provider. Specifically, you may be required to pay higher cost sharing
amounts or may have limits on your benefits when using Out-of-Network Providers. Please see the
Schedule of Benefits in this Benefit Booklet for your cost share responsibilities and limitations, or call
Member Services to learn howthis Plan’s benefits or cost share amounts may vary by the type of Provider
you use.
The Claims Administrator will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You may be
responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether
such services are performed by a Network or Out-of-Network Provider. Non-Covered Services include
services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of your policyand services received after benefits
have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, your lifetime maximum,
benefit caps or day/visit limits.
Example:
 You choose aNetwork surgeon. The chargewas $2500. The Maximum AllowedAmount forthesurgery
is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility when a Network surgeon is used is 20% of $1500, or $300.
The Claims Administrator pays 80% of $1500, or $1200. The Network surgeon accepts the total of
$1500 as reimbursement for the surgery regardless of the charges. Your total out of pocket
responsibilitywould be $300.
 You choose an Out-of-Network surgeon. The Out-of-Network surgeon’s charge for the service is
$2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery service is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility
for the Out-of-Network surgeon is 50% of $1500, or $750 after the Out-of-Network Deductible has been
met. The Claims Administrator pays the remaining 50% of $1500, or $750. In addition, the Out-ofNetwork surgeon could bill you the difference between $2500 and $1500 so, your total out of pocket
charge would be $750 plus an additional $1000, for a total of $1750.
101
AUTHORIZEDSERVICES
In some circumstances,such as where there is noNetwork Provider available for theCovered Service, the
Claims Administrator may authorize the Network cost share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or
Coinsurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service you receive from an Out-of-Network Provider. In
such circumstance,you must contact theClaimsAdministrator in advance ofobtaining theCovered Service.
The Claims Administrator also may authorize the Network cost share amounts to apply to a claim for
Covered Services if you receive Emergency services from an Out-of-Network Provider and are not able to
contact the Claims Administrator until after the Covered Service is rendered. If the Claims Administrator
authorizes a Network cost share amount to apply to a Covered Service received from an Out-of-Network
Provider, you also may still be liable for the difference between the Maximum AllowedAmountand theOutof-Network Provider’s charge. Please contact Member Services for Authorized Services information or to
request authorization.
Example:
You require the services of a specialty Provider; but there is no Network Provider for that specialty in your
state of residence. You contact the Claims Administrator in advance of receiving any Covered Services,
and they authorize you to go to an available Out-of-Network Provider for that Covered Service and they
agree that the Network cost share will apply.
Your Plan has a $45 Copayment for Out-of-Network Providers and a $25 Copayment for Network
Providers of participating providers for theCovered Service.TheOut-of-Network Provider’s charge for
this service is $500. The Maximum Allowed Amount is $200.
Because the Claims Administrator has authorized the Network cost share amount to apply in this
situation, you will be responsible for theNetwork Copayment of $25 and the Claims Administrator will be
responsible for the remaining $175 of the $200 Maximum Allowed Amount.
Because the Out-of-Network Provider’s charge for this service is $500, you may receive a bill from the
Out-of-Network Provider for the difference between the$500 charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount
of $200. Combined with your Network Copayment of $25, your total out of pocket expense would be
$325.
Claims Review
The Claims Administrator has processes to review claims before and after payment to detect fraud,
waste, abuse and other inappropriate activity. Members seeking services from Out-of-Network Providers
could be balanced billed by theOut-of-Network Provider for those services that are determined to be not
payable as a result of these review processes. A claim mayalso be determined to be not payable due to
a Provider's failure to submit medical records with the claims that are under review in these processes.
Notice of Claim & Proof of Loss
When you have received Covered Services, the Claims Administrator must receive written notice of your
claim within 90 days in order for benefits to be paid. Your claim must have the information the Claims
Administrator needs to determine benefits. Services received and charges for the services must be
itemized, and clearly and accurately described. If it is not reasonably possible to submit the claim within
that time frame, an extension of up to 12 months will be allowed. Claim forms must be used; canceled
checks or receipts are not acceptable. If the ClaimsAdministrator isunable to complete processing
of a claim because you or your Provider failsto provide uswith the additional information, the
claim maybe denied.
102
Claim Forms
Claim forms will usuallybe available from most Providers. If forms are not available, contact your Student
Health Center, or via the web at: www.ucship.edu/ucship, or UC SHIP Member Services at 1-866-940-
8306 and ask for a claim form to be sent to you. If you do not receive the claim form, written notice of
services rendered may be submitted without the claim form.The same information that would be given on
the claim form must be included in the written notice of claim. This includes:
 Name of patient.
 Patient’s relationship with the student.
 Identification number.
 Date, type, andplace of service.
 Your signature and the Provider’s signature.
Member’sCooperation
You will be expected to complete and submit to the Claims Administrator all such authorizations,
consents, releases, assignments and other documents that maybe needed in order to obtain or assure
reimbursement under Medicare,Worker’s Compensation or any other governmental program. If you fail
to cooperate you will be responsible for any charge for services.
Payment of Benefits
The Claims Administrator may make benefit payments directlyto Network Providers for Covered
Services. If you use an Out-of-Network Provider, however, the Claims Administrator may make benefit
payments to you. Payments may also be made to, and notice regarding the receipt and/or adjudication of
claims sent to, an Alternate Recipient (anychild of a student who is recognized, under a Qualified Medical
Child Support Order (QMSCO), as having a right to enrollment under the Plan), or that person’s custodial
parent or designated representative. Any benefit payments made will discharge the Plan’s obligation to
pay for Covered Services. You cannot assign your right to benefits to anyone else, except as required by
a Qualified Medical Child Support Order as defined by any applicable state law.
Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, the Claims Administrator will not honor a request for us to
withhold payment of the claims submitted.
Inter-Plan Arrangements
Out-of-Area Services
Overview
Anthem has a variety of relationships with other BlueCross and Blue Shield Licensees. Generally,
these relationshipsare called “Inter-PlanArrangements.” These Inter-PlanArrangements work based on
rules and procedures issued by the BlueCross Blue ShieldAssociation (“Association”). Whenever you
access healthcare servicesoutside the geographicareaAnthem serves (the “Anthem Service Area”),the
claim for those services may be processed through oneof these Inter-PlanArrangements. The Inter-Plan
Arrangements aredescribedbelow.
When you receive care outside of the Anthem ServiceArea, you willreceive it from one of two kinds of
Providers. Most Providers (“participating providers”) contractwith the localBlueCross and/orBlueShield
Plan inthat geographic area(“Host Blue”). SomeProviders (“nonparticipating providers”)don’t contract
with theHost Blue. Weexplain belowhowwe pay both kinds of Providers.
103
Inter-Plan ArrangementsEligibility –ClaimTypes
Most claim typesareeligible to beprocessed through Inter-PlanArrangements,as described above.
Examples of claims that are not included are Prescription Drugs that you obtain from a Pharmacyand
most dental or vision benefits.
A. BlueCard®Program
Under the BlueCard® Program, when you receive Covered Services within the geographic area served
by a Host Blue, Anthem will still fulfill their contractual obligations. But, the Host Blue is responsible for:
(a) contracting with its Provider; and (b) handling its interactions with those Providers.
When you receive Covered Services outside the Anthem Service Area and the claim is processed
through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay is calculated based on the lower of:
• The billed charges for Covered Services; or
• The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Anthem.
Often, this “negotiated price” will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays
to the Provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with that
Provider. Sometimes, such an arrangement may be an average price, based on a discount that results in
expected average savings for services provided by similar types of Providers.
Estimated pricing and average pricing also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or
underestimation of past pricing of claims as noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the
price Anthem uses for your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has already been paid.
B. Negotiated (non-BlueCardProgram)Arrangements
With respect tooneor moreHost Blues,instead of using the BlueCardProgram, Anthem may process
your claims forCovered Services throughNegotiatedArrangements forNational Accounts.
The amount you pay for Covered Services underthis arrangement will becalculated based on the lowerof
eitherbilled charges for Covered Services orthe negotiated price (refer tothe description of negotiated
price underSectionA. BlueCardProgram)made available to Anthem by the Host Blue.
D. Inter-PlanPrograms:Federal/StateTaxes/Surcharges/Fees
Federal or state laws or regulationsmay require asurcharge, tax or otherfee. If applicable, Anthem will
include any such surcharge, tax or otherfeeas part of the claim charge passed on to you.
E. NonparticipatingProvidersOutside TheServiceArea
The pricing method used for non-participating provider claims incurred outside the Anthem Service Area
is described in"Claims Payment".
F. BCBS Global CoreProgram
If you Plan to travel outside the United States, call Member Services to find out your BCBS Global Core
benefits. Benefits for services received outside of the United States maybe different from services
received in the United States. Remember to take an up to date health Identification Card with you.
When you are traveling abroad and need medical care, you can call theBCBS Global Core Service
Center any time. They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The toll free number is 800-
810-2583. Or you can call them collect at 804-673-1177.
104
If you need Inpatient Hospital care, you or someone on your behalf, should contact the Claims
Administrator for preauthorization. Keep in mind, if you need Emergencymedical care, go to the nearest
hospital. There is no need to call before you receive care.
Please refer to the “Getting Approval for Benefits” section in this Benefit Booklet for further information.
You can learn how to get preauthorization when you need to be admitted to the Hospital for Emergency
or non-Emergency care.
How Claims are Paid with BCBS Global Core

pay benefits before the benefit provided under this Plan.
105
Coordination of Benefits When Members Are Insured Under
More Than One Plan
The coverage underthisPlan is secondary coverage to all other plans (including Medicare),
except Medi-Cal, MRMIP, and TRICARE, for any servicesnot provided by the student health
services.
If you are covered by more than one health plan, your benefits under this Planwill be coordinated with the
benefits of those Other Plans. These coordination provisions apply separately to each Member, per Plan
Year. Any coverage you have for medical or pediatric dental benefits, will be coordinated as shown
below.
DEFINITIONS
The meanings of key terms used in this section are shown below. Whenever any of the key terms shown
below appear in these provisions, the first letter of each word will be capitalized. When you see these
capitalized words, you shouldrefer to this “Definitions” provision.
Allowable Expense is any necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense which is at least
partially covered by any plan covering the person for whom claim is made. When a plan provides
benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, the reasonable cash value of each service
rendered will be deemed to be both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not
covered by any plan covering the person for whom a claim is made is not an Allowable Expense.
The following arenot Allowable Expense:
1. Use of a private hospital room is not anAllowable Expense unless the patient's stay in a private
Hospital room is Medically Necessary in terms of generallyaccepted medical practice, or one of the
plans routinely provides coverage for hospital private rooms.
2. If you are covered by two plans that calculate benefits or services on the basis of a reasonable and
customary amount or relative value schedule reimbursement method or some other similar
reimbursement method, any amount in excess of the higher of the reasonable and customary
amounts.
3. If a person is covered by two plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated rates
or fees, an amount in excess of the lower of the negotiated rates.
4. If a person is covered by one plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of a reasonable
and customaryamount or relative value schedule reimbursementmethod or some other similar
reimbursement method and another plan provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated
rates or fees, any amount in excess of the negotiated rate.
5. The amount of any benefit reduction by thePrincipal Plan because you did not comply with the plan’s
provisions is not an Allowable Expense. Examples of these types of provisions include second
surgical opinions,utilization reviewrequirements, and network provider arrangements.
6. If you advise the Claims Administrator that all plans covering you are high deductible health plans as
defined by Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code, and you intend to contribute to a health
savings account established in accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code, any
amount that is subject tothe primary high deductible health plan’s deductible.
Other Plan is any of the following:
1. Group, blanket orfranchise insurance coverage;
2. Group service plan contract, group practice, group individual practice andother group prepayment
coverages;
106
3. Group coverage under labor-management trusteed plans,union benefitorganization plans, employer
organization plans, employee benefit organization plans or self-insured employee benefit plans.
4. Medicare. This does not include Medicare when, by law, its benefits are secondary to those of any
private insurance program orother non-governmental program, including aself-insured program.
5. National CollegiateAthletic Association (NCAA) orthe NationalAssociation of Intercollegiate Athletics
(NAIA)
The term "Other Plan" refers separately to each agreement, policy, contract, or other arrangement for
services and benefits, and onlyto that portion of such agreement, policy, contract, or arrangement which
reserves the right to take the services or benefits of other plans into consideration in determining benefits.
Principal Plan is the plan which will have its benefits determined first.
ThisPlan is that portion of this Plan which provides benefits subject to this provision.
EFFECT ON BENEFITS
This provision will apply in determining a person’s benefits under This Plan for any Calendar Year if the
benefits under This Plan and any Other Plans, exceed the Allowable Expenses for that Calendar Year.
1. If This Plan is the Principal Plan, then its benefits will be determined first without taking into account
the benefits or services of any Other Plan.
2. If This Plan is not the Principal Plan, then its benefits may be reduced so that the benefits and
services of all the plans do not exceed Allowable Expense.
3. The benefits of This Plan will never be greater than the sum of the benefits that would have been paid
if you were covered under This Plan only.
ORDER OF BENEFITS DETERMINATION
The first of the following rules which applies will determine the order in which benefits are payable:
1. A member is treated at the Student Health Center. UC SHIP is primary for these services. You may
have to submit your receipt to your other health plan for reimbursement.
2. A plan which has no Coordination of Benefits provision pays before a plan which has a Coordination
of Benefits provision. This would include Medicare in all cases, except when the law requires that
This Plan pays before Medicare.
Note: This Plan is secondary coverage to all other policies except Medi-Cal, MRMIP, and TRICARE.
3. In most cases, a plan which covers you as a Member pays before a plan which covers you as a
dependent. However, UC SHIP is secondaryto all other plans except Medi-Cal, MRMIP, and
TRICARE. Another exception is if you are retired and eligible for Medicare, Medicare pays (a) after
the plan which covers you as a dependent of an active employee, but (b) before the plan which
covers you as a retired employee.
107
THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR’S RIGHTSUNDERTHIS PROVISION
Responsibility ForTimely Notice. TheClaims Administrator is not responsible for coordination of
benefits unless timelyinformation has been provided by the requesting party regarding the application of
this provision.
Reasonable Cash Value. If any Other Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash
payment, the reasonable cash value of services provided will be considered Allowable Expense. The
reasonable cash value of such service will be considered a benefit paid, and our liabilityreduced
accordingly.
Facilityof Payment. If payments which should have been made under This Plan have been made under
any Other Plan, the Claims Administrator has the right to pay that Other Plan any amount they determine
to be warranted to satisfy the intent of this provision. Any such amount will be considered a benefit paid

Provider for Covered Service, at the Claims Administrator’s discretion. In the event that payment is made
directly to you, you have the responsibility to apply this payment to the claim from the Out-of-Network
Provider. Payments and notice regarding the receipt and/or adjudication of claims may also be sent to an
Alternate Recipient (which is defined herein as any child of a Subscriber who is recognized under a
“Qualified Medical Child Support Order” as having a right to enrollment under the Group’s Plan), or that
person’s custodial parent or designated representative. Any payments made by the Claims Administrator
(whether to any Provider for Covered Service or you) will discharge the Claims Administrator’s obligation
to pay for Covered Services. You cannot assign your right to receive payment to anyone, except as
required by a “Qualified Medical Child Support Order” as defined by or any applicable Federal law.
Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, the Claims Administrator will not honor a request for us to
withhold payment of theclaims submitted.

authority, in its discretion, to introduce or terminate from time to time, pilot or test programs for disease
management, care management, or wellness initiatives which may result in the payment of benefits not
otherwise specified in this Booklet. The Claim's Administrator reserves the right to discontinue a pilot or test

It’s important we treat you fairly
That’s why we follow federal civil rights laws in our health programs and activities. We don’t discriminate,
exclude people, or treat them differently on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. For
people with disabilities, we offer free aids and services. For people whose primary language isn’t English,
we offer free language assistance services through interpreters and other written languages. Interested in
these services? Call the Member Services number on your ID card for help (TTY/TDD: 711). If you think we
failed to offer these services or discriminated based on race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex, you
can file a complaint, also known as a grievance. You can file a complaint with our Compliance Coordinator
in writing to Compliance Coordinator, P.O. Box 27401, Mail Drop VA2002-N160, Richmond, VA 23279. Or
you can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights at
