UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY 2022 - 2023 STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN
When Coverage Ends
Insurance terminates at 11:59 p.m. local time at the
Policyholder’s address. Your insurance will terminate at
11:59 p.m. on the earliest of:
• Date the Policy terminates; or
• End of the period of coverage for which premium
has been paid; or
• The date the Insured Person ceases to be eligible
for the insurance; or
• Date the Insured Person enters military service.
Your dependent may become eligible for coverage under the
Plan only when you become eligible; or within 60 days of a
qualifying life event. Dependent coverage will not be
effective prior to that of the insured student or extend
beyond that of the insured student.
Extension of Benefits
Coverage under the Plan ceases on the Termination Date of
your insurance coverage. However, the Company will extend
coverage for you as follows:
If you are Hospital Confined for a Covered Injury or Covered
Sickness and under a Physician’s care on the date your
insurance coverage terminates, we will continue to pay
benefits until the earliest of: (1) the date the Hospital
Confinement ends; or (2) the end of the 30 day period
following the date your coverage terminated.
Dependents that are newly acquired during your Extension
of Benefits period are not eligible for benefits under this
provision.
Premium Refund/Cancellation
A refund of premium will be considered for the reasons
listed below only. No other refunds will be granted.
If an insured student or the insured student’s dependent
enters the Armed Forces of any country, the insured student
or the insured student’s dependent will not be covered
under the Plan as of the date of such entry. If the insured
student enters the Armed Forces of any country, coverage
for the student and the insured student’s dependent(s) will
be terminated as of the date of entry into the service. If the
insured student’s dependent enters the armed forces of any
country, coverage for the dependent will terminate as of the
date of such entry. A pro rata refund of premium will be
made for such person upon written request received by AHP
within 45 days of entry into service.
How Do I Waive?
All eligible registered full time domestic and international
students will be automatically enrolled in the Berkeley
Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). If you already have an
insurance plan in place that meets all of the waiver criteria
established by University of California, Berkeley, you may
submit an online waiver application with your insurance
information during the waiver period. The waiver periods are
listed on page six of this brochure. To complete an online
waiver, please visit:
https://uhs.berkeley.edu/insurance/waiving-ship
Fall waiver applications are completed during the summer
for the upcoming academic year. The fall semester waiver
will be valid for the full academic year. A student who waives
Berkeley SHIP for the fall semester will not be required to
complete another waiver for the spring semester. However,
a spring waiver is available for students registering for the
first time in the spring, or who did not waive enrollment for
the fall semester. A spring semester waiver is valid for the
remainder of the academic year. A new waiver must be
completed and approved during the fall waiver period prior
to each academic year that the eligible student is registered.
UC Berkeley will audit waiver submissions and has sole
discretion on determining whether a plan meets the waiver
criteria at any given time.
ID Cards
You will receive a SHIP Welcome kit with links to access
your online ID Card, which will arrive shortly after
enrollment. You will have access to the electronic version
of your ID card at My SHIP Online. By accessing your digital
ID card, you don’t have to keep the plastic version in your
wallet anymore. If your ID card is lost/stolen, simply pull it
up on your computer or mobile device at:
http://berkeley.wellfleetinsurance.com/ship.
To register for My SHIP Online simply click the “Sign Up” in
the top right-hand corner of the screen and you will be
guided through the Sign-Up process. In My SHIP Online you
will be able to:
• View your ID card
• Print out a copy of your ID card
• Email your card to yourself and/or a provider
• View and submit claims
• Find an in-network provider
If you require assistance with your ID Card, please call
Member Services at (833) 302-9785.
University Health Services
University Health Services, AKA the Tang Center, is a
comprehensive outpatient health center that provides on
campus medical, behavioral health, and preventive care. The
Tang Center is staffed by board-certified physicians, nurse
practitioners, physician assistants, and nurses, who are
experts in student health needs. Tang Center clinicians
provide primary care for Berkeley SHIP students and
coordinate any needed additional care. All registered
students may use the services of Tang Center, regardless of
their medical insurance. Many services are offered at a
reduced price to students.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY 2022 - 2023 STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN
Visit the Tang Center website at https://uhs.berkeley.edu or
call (510) 642-2000 for more information on hours of
operation, available services and fees. Counseling and
Psychological Services can be reached at (510) 642-9494.
• In the event of an emergency, go to the nearest hospital
emergency department or call 911 (on-campus or offcampus) if an ambulance is needed. The closest hospital
emergency room to campus is Alta Bates Hospital, 2450
Ashby Avenue (east of Telegraph Avenue).
• When Tang Center is open: Visit Urgent Care at Tang
Center.
• When Tang Center is closed: Call the 24/7 NurseLine at
(800) 681-4065 or use Teladoc services at (800) 835-2362
or visit https://www.teladoc.com/wellfleetstudent.
Where Do I Go For Services?
University Health Services or UHS (AKA the Tang Center) is
your primary care provider (PCP). Your PCP coordinates your
care, facilitates referrals, and acts as your health care
advocate. All care with the exception of medical
emergencies and some other specific services (see below
for exception details) must be coordinated through UHS.
You can access care at the Tang Center through in person
appointments, advice nurse, appointment office, or Urgent
Care center to coordinate your care.
Exceptions to referral requirement:
1. Emergency Medical Condition or Urgent Care.
2. Services outside the country.
3. Certain women’s health services including pregnancy
and maternity care.
4. Certain preventive and well visit services.
With the exception of the above services, a referral from
Tang Center is required for all non-emergency services
performed outside of the Tang Center prior to receiving
treatment outside of the Tang Center. If a referral is not
obtained prior to treatment, benefits are not payable.
The Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) network allows
Insured Persons easy access to a wide range of medical
providers. Insured Persons have the option to receive care
from a provider who is not participating in the PPO network.
The trade-off is higher out-of-pocket expenses. Participating
providers (PPO Providers) agree to provide services to
Insured Persons at discounted rates as payment in full. This
is the incentive for Insured Persons to use PPO providers and
protects them from being balance-billed (except for
coinsurance, copayments and deductible amounts).
Providers working within a PPO facility (example: a hospital)
may not always be PPO providers. You should request all of
your provider services be performed by a PPO Provider
when you use a PPO facility. When Non-PPO providers are
used, you may be subject to higher out-of-pocket expenses.
Additionally, PPO physicians agree to admit their patients to
network hospitals, guaranteeing discounted charges and
utilization management savings will occur.
With no claim forms to file, Insured Persons can focus on
their health, not paperwork.
Insured Persons can find a PPO physician in their area by
calling Member Services at (833) 302-9785 or
http://berkeley.wellfleetinsurance.com/ship/providers.
When the Insured Person receives Emergency Services, or
Out-of-Network air Ambulance Services, or certain nonemergency Treatment by an Out-of-Network Provider at an
In-Network Hospital or Ambulatory Surgical Center without
the Insured Person’s consent, the Insured Person is
protected from Surprise Billing. In these situations, the
Insured Person’s cost sharing responsibility is calculated as
if the total amount that would be charged for the services
by an In-Network Provider or facility were equal to the
Recognized Amount for the services, which is the lesser of
the Actual Amount billed by the provider or facility and the
Qualifying Payment Amount. Refer to the Preferred
Provider Organization provision in the How The Plan Works
And Description Of Benefits section of the Certificate for
additional information.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY 2022 - 2023 STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN

in this Plan unless an approved online Waiver Form has been
received by the University by the specified waiver deadline
dates listed in the “How Much Does It Cost” section of the
“Benefits at a Glance.”
• All eligible registered domestic and international
undergraduate and graduate students of the University
of California Berkeley including eligible students who
are registered-in-absentia. Note: An eligible student
may waive enrollment in the Plan during the specified
waiver period by meeting the University’s waiver
policies and providing proof of other coverage. A waiver
is effective for one academic year and must be
completed and approved again during the waiver period
at the start of each fall term of the academic year.
Waiver requests for each academic term within a year
are also available. Information about waiving
enrollment in the Plan may be obtained from the
Student Health Insurance Plan Office at:
https://uhs.berkeley.edu/insurance.
Voluntary Enrollments
The following classes of eligible students may enroll in the
UC Berkeley SHIP on a voluntary basis directly with
Academic HealthPlans (AHP) by the specified enrollment
deadline dates listed in the “How Much Does It Cost”
section of the “Benefits at a Glance.” For voluntary
enrollment, visit: https://uhs.berkeley.edu/insurance/shipnon-registered-students.
• All non-registered “Filing Fee” status graduate students
of the University of California Berkeley who are
completing work under the auspices of the University of
California Berkeley but are not attending classes.
Students on Filing Fee status may purchase Plan
coverage for a maximum of one semester. An eligible
student must have been covered by SHIP in the term
immediately preceding the term the student wants to
purchase.
• All non-registered Concurrent Enrollment status
undergraduate students of the University of California
Berkeley may purchase Plan coverage for a maximum of
one semester. An eligible student must have been
covered by SHIP in the term immediately preceding the
term the student wants to purchase.
To be an Insured Person under the Plan, the student must
have paid the required premium and his/her name, student
number and date of birth must have been included in the
declaration made by UC Berkeley or AHP to the Company.
Mandatory and Voluntary Enrollments
Except in the case of medical withdrawal from school due
to sickness or injury, any student who cancels enrollment
or withdraws from UC Berkeley prior to attending at least
the first day of classes for the period for which he or she is
enrolled shall not be covered under the insurance plan. A
student who graduates or withdraws after attending the
first day of classes for the period for which he or she is
enrolled will remain covered under the Plan for the term
purchased and no refund will be allowed. For additional
information, please go to https://uhs.berkeley.edu/ship.
The Company and AHP maintain the right to investigate
student eligibility status and attendance records to verify
that the Plan’s eligibility requirements have been met. If and
whenever the Company and/or AHP discover the eligibility
requirements have not been met, the Company’s only
obligation is a refund of premium less any claims paid.
Eligible students who involuntarily lose coverage under
another health insurance plan are also eligible to purchase
the Student Health Insurance Plan. These students must
provide UC Berkeley with proof they have lost insurance
through another health insurance plan (certificate and letter
of ineligibility) within 60 days of the qualifying event. The
effective date of your coverage will be the later of the
following dates: (1) the Policy effective date; (2) the day
after the date for which you lose your coverage providing
premium for your coverage has been paid; (3) the date UC
Berkeley’s term of coverage begins; or (4) the date you
become a member of an eligible class of persons. Premium
will not be prorated.
Medical Leave of Absence
A student withdrawing due to a University approved
medical leave due to a Sickness or Injury may be eligible to
continue coverage under the Plan for himself/herself and
his or her previously insured dependents for one semester
with the payment of any required premium. To be eligible,
the student must have been enrolled in the UC Berkeley
SHIP the semester immediately preceding the semester for
which he or she is withdrawing due to a Sickness or Injury.
The student must submit documentation or certification of
the medical withdrawal and payment of any required
premium must be made to AHP at least 30 days prior to the
medical leave of absence from the school, if the medical
reason for the absence and the absence are foreseeable, or
30 days after the date of the medical leave from school.
Please contact the Berkeley SHIP Office at (510) 642-5700 or
ship@berkeley.edu for more details.
Dependent Coverage
Note: Dependent enrollment in this plan is voluntary.
Eligible students, including those who enroll in the Plan on a
voluntary basis, may also enroll their eligible dependents.
Dependents may only be enrolled at the time of the
student’s enrollment in the Plan; or within 60 days of
qualifying life event.
8
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY 2022 - 2023 STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN
Eligible dependents are the insured student’s lawful spouse,
or domestic partner who resides with the insured student,
and the insured student's, the spouse's, or the domestic
partner’s dependent biological or adopted child or stepchild
under 26 years of age. To enroll your domestic partner, a
Declaration of Domestic Partnership issued by the State of
California; or proof of a same sex legal union other than
marriage formed in another jurisdiction; or a completed
Declaration of Domestic Partnership form issued by
University Health Services is necessary. A “Newborn” will
automatically be covered from the moment of birth. Such
newborn child will be covered for medically necessary health
care services for an initial period of 31 days OR until the
insured student’s coverage terminates, if earlier. Coverage
of a newborn may be continued beyond this initial 31 day
period by notifying AHP within 31 daysfrom the date of birth
and by payment of any additional premium. All newborn
children should be reported to the Berkeley SHIP Office at
ship@berkeley.edu. Dependents must be enrolled for the
same term of coverage for which the insured student is
enrolled. Dependent coverage expires concurrently with
that of the insured student and dependents must re-enroll
when coverage terminates to maintain coverage.
Dependents must be re-enrolled each term. It is the
student's responsibility to re-enroll your dependents each
term, prior to the enrollment deadline date listed in the
“Benefits at a Glance.” To enroll your eligible dependent(s),
you must go to:
https://uhs.berkeley.edu/insurance/insurance-dependents.
Prescription Drug Benefits
To fill a prescription, take your prescription to a participating
pharmacy and present your member ID card. The amount
you pay for a covered prescription – your copayment – will
be determined by the tier of the drug under the formulary.
Higher tiers are associated with higher copays. Generic drug
means a drug that is the same as its brand name drug
equivalent in dosage, strength, effect, how it is taken,
quality, safety, and intended use. Brand name drugs are
marketed under a proprietary, trademark-protected name.
Tier 1 drugs are preferred generic drugs. Tier 2 drugs are
preferred brand name drugs and high cost generics. Tier 3
drugs are non-preferred drugs. Some formulary drugs have
coverage requirements and limits, such as prior
authorization, quantity limits, and step therapy. Drugs
identified as specialty drugs have a higher copay associated
with them. The formulary is available online at
https://uhs.berkeley.edu/insurance/shipbenefits/prescriptions. You or your provider may also
contact Member Services at (833) 302-9785.
A general description of what is covered under your
Prescription Drug Benefit is listed below. Coverage is subject
to the requirements and limits indicated in the formulary.
- Outpatient prescription drugs and medications which the
law restricts to sale by prescription.
- Formulas prescribed by a physician for the treatment of
phenylketonuria.
- Insulin, insulin syringes, and diabetic supplies, such as
blood glucose test strips, lancets, and glucometers.
- Prescription contraceptives; including oral contraceptives,
diaphragms, and patches. Contraceptives may be covered
as preventive care services at no copay and are noted as
$0 under the drug tier in the formulary.
- Self-administered injectable drugs as labeled by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).
- Certain compound drugs that contain at least one covered
prescription ingredient.
- Prescription drugs for treatment of impotence and/or
sexual dysfunction.
- Inhaler spacers and peak flow meters.
Prescription drug copayments apply toward the Policy Year Out-of-Pocket Maximums.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY 2022 - 2023 STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN
1 Dispense as Written: If a prescriber prescribes a covered brand name drug where a generic drug equivalent is available and
specifies: “Dispense as Written” (DAW), You will pay the copayment for the brand name drug. If a prescriber does not specify
DAW and you request a covered brand name drug where a generic drug equivalent is available, you will be responsible for the
cost difference between the brand name drug and the generic drug equivalent, and the copayment that applies to brand name
drugs. This DAW penalty does not apply to your out-of-pocket maximum or deductible.
How the Student Health Insurance Plan Works
In addition to coinsurance and copayments, insured persons are responsible for deductibles, as described in the Schedule of
Benefits below. Please review the deductible information to know if a deductible applies to a specific covered service. Insured
persons who elects to use an Out-of-Network Provider are also responsible for all costs over the usual and customary charge.
Certain covered services have maximum visit and/or day limits per year. The number of visits and/or days allowed for these services
will begin accumulating on the first visit and/or day, regardless of whether your deductible has been met.
Benefits are subject to all terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the Plan.
Referral Requirements
University Health Services or UHS (AKA the Tang Center) is your primary care provider (PCP). Your PCP coordinates your care,
facilitates referrals, and acts as your health care advocate.
All care with the exception of medical emergencies and some other specific services (see below for exception details) must be
coordinated through UHS. You can access care at Tang through in person appointments, advice nurse, appointment office, or

Preferred Provider Organization
If you use an In-Network Provider, you will pay the coinsurance percentage of the negotiated charge for covered medical expenses
shown in the Schedule of Benefits below.
If an Out-of-Network Provider is used, you will pay the coinsurance percentage of the usual and customary charge for covered
medical expenses shown in the Schedule of Benefits below. The difference between the provider fee and the coinsurance amount
paid by the Company will be your responsibility.
Note, however, the Company will pay at the In-Network level for treatment by an Out-of-Network Provider and will calculate your
cost sharing amount at the In-Network Provider level, and your cost share will be applied to your In-Network deductible and outof-pocket maximum if:
1. There is no In-Network Provider within a 25-mile radius of the Preferred Provider service area available to provide a preventive
service or treat you for a specific covered injury or covered sickness; or
2. You have an emergency medical condition and receive emergency services from an Out-of-Network Provider or facility. The
most the Out-of-Network Provider or facility may bill you is the In-Network cost sharing amount (such as deductibles,
copayments and coinsurance). You can’t be balance billed for these emergency services. This includes services you may get
after you’re in stable condition, unless the Out-of-Network Provider or facility determines that you can travel using nonmedical or non-emergency transportation, the Out-of-Network Provider provides proper notice and consent, and you are in a
condition to receive notice of, and to consent to, Out-of-Network treatment; or
3. You receive non-emergency services from an In-Network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, but certain providers there
may be Out-of-Network Providers. In these cases, the most those Out-of-Network Providers may bill you without consent is
the In-Network cost sharing amount. You can’t be balance billed or asked to give up your protections for ancillary services,
including emergency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist,
intensivist services, and items and services provided by an Out-of-Network Provider if there is no In-Network Provider who
can furnish such item or service at such facility, or items or services furnished as a result of unforeseen, urgent medical needs
that arise at the time an item or service is furnished, regardless of whether the Out-of-Network Provider satisfied proper notice
and consent.
10
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY 2022 - 2023 STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN
However, if you received notice from the Out-of-Network Provider of their non-network status under the following
circumstances, we will pay covered medical expenses at the Out-of-Network level as shown in the Schedule of Benefits:
If the appointment is scheduled at least 72 hours prior to the date of service, and notice is provided not later than 72 hours
prior to the date of service;
• If the appointment is scheduled within 72 hours prior to the date of service, and notice is provided on the date the
appointment is scheduled; or
• If the appointment is scheduled on the date of service, and notice is provided no later than 3 hours prior to the service;
and
• You gave written consent to treatment, this Certificate will pay covered medical expenses at the Out-of-Network level as
shown in the Schedule of Benefits.
Please note, the Preferred Provider Organization for Berkeley SHIP is Blue Shield of California within the State of California and
Cigna outside of California.
Medical Benefit Payments for In-Network Providers and Out-of-Network Providers
The Plan provides benefits based on the type of health care provider you and your covered dependent selects. The Plan provides
access to both In-Network Providers and Out-of-Network Providers. Different benefits may be payable for covered medical
expenses rendered by In-Network Providers versus Out-of-Network Providers, as shown in the Schedule of Benefits below.
When you receive emergency services, or Out-of-Network air ambulance services, or certain non-emergency treatment by an Outof-Network Provider at an In-Network hospital or ambulatory surgical center without your consent, you are protected from surprise
billing. In these situations, your cost sharing responsibility will be calculated as if the total amount that would be charged for the
services by an In-Network Provider or facility were equal to the recognized amount for the services, which is the lesser of the actual
amount billed by the provider or facility and the qualifying payment amount. Refer to the Preferred Provider Organization provision
above for additional information.

Limitations
Alternate Benefits: Where two or more professionally acceptable dental treatments for a dental condition exist,
payment is based on the least costly treatment alternative. If you and your dentist have agreed on a treatment that
is more costly than the treatment upon which the plan benefit is based, you will be responsible for any additional
payment responsibility. To avoid any misunderstandings, we suggest you discuss treatment options with your
dentist before services are rendered, and obtain a pre-treatment estimate of benefits prior to receiving certain high
cost services such as crowns, bridges or dentures. You and your dentist will each receive an Explanation of
Benefits (EOB) outlining the services provided, your plan’s payment for those services, and your out-of-pocket
expense. Actual payments may vary from the pretreatment estimate depending upon annual maximums, plan
frequency limits, deductibles and other limits applicable at time of payment.
Cancellation/Termination of Benefits: Coverage is provided under a group insurance policy (Policy form
GPNP99 / G.2130-S) issued by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). Coverage terminates when your
participation ceases, when your dental contributions cease or upon termination of the group policy by the
Policyholder or MetLife. The group policy terminates for non-payment of premium and may terminate if participation
requirements are not met or if the Policyholder fails to perform any obligations under the policy. The following
services that are in progress while coverage is in effect will be paid after the coverage ends, if the applicable
installment or the treatment is finished within 31 days after individual termination of coverage: Completion of a
prosthetic device, crown or root canal therapy.
Group dental insurance policies featuring the Preferred Dentist Program are underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company, New York, NY 10166.

apply, ask your dentist to visit www.metdental.com, or call 1-866-PDP-NTWK for an application.†† The website
and phone number are for use by dental professionals only.
Q. How are claims processed?
A. Dentists may submit your claims for you which means you have little or no paperwork. You can track your
claims online and even receive email alerts when a claim has been processed. If you need a claim form, visit
www.metlife.com/mybenefits or request one by calling 1-800-942-0854
Q. Can I get an estimate of what my out-of-pocket expenses will be before receiving a service?
A. Yes. You can ask for a pretreatment estimate. Your general dentist or specialist usually sends MetLife a plan
for your care and requests an estimate of benefits. The estimate helps you prepare for the cost of dental
services. We recommend that you request a pre-treatment estimate for services in excess of $300. Simply
have your dentist submit a request online at www.metdental.com or call 1-877-MET-DDS9. You and your
dentist will receive a benefit estimate for most procedures while you are still in the office. Actual payments may
vary depending upon plan maximums, deductibles, frequency limits and other conditions at time of payment.
Q. Can MetLife help me find a dentist outside of the U.S. if I am traveling?
A. Yes. Through international dental travel assistance services* you can obtain a referral to a local dentist by
calling +1-312-356-5970 (collect) when outside the U.S. to receive immediate care until you can see your
dentist. Coverage will be considered under your out-of-network benefits.** Please remember to hold on to all
receipts to submit a dental claim.
Q. How does MetLife coordinate benefits with other insurance plans?
A. Coordination of benefits provisions in dental benefits plans are a set of rules that are followed when a patient is
covered by more than one dental benefits plan. These rules determine the order in which the plans will pay
benefits. If the MetLife dental benefit plan is primary, MetLife will pay the full amount of benefits that would
normally be available under the plan, subject to applicable law. If the MetLife dental benefit plan is secondary,
most coordination of benefits provisions require MetLife to determine benefits after benefits have been
determined under the primary plan. The amount of benefits payable by MetLife may be reduced due to the
benefits paid under the primary plan, subject to applicable law.
Q. Do I need an ID card?
A. No. You do not need to present an ID card to confirm that you are eligible. You should notify your dentist that
you are enrolled in the MetLife Preferred Dentist Program. Your dentist can easily verify information about your
coverage through a toll-free automated Computer Voice Response system.
